== Overview
// <Related Technology>
Google Cloud Registry requires the storage.admin permission in order to enumerate repositories in a registry. This is done via wildcards. If the credentials you pass into the defender has readonly permissions it will be able to scan specific repositories in the registry as expected, but wildcards will fail.
// Give a brief description on what the underlying technology is. For example - Does this relate to aws? or is this a daemonset install issue? Or gcr registry scanning? etc. 

== Error messages
// How would the issue appear? If a user wanted to confirm if this issue applied to him, what does he need to look for? Provide step by step procedure
There are no error messages. Nothing shows up in the logs.

== Steps to confirm the issue
// Anything in logs or on host that the customer would need to check to confirm if it's the same issue?
* Scan a repository in your registry
* Add in a wildcard
** At this step nothing should happen. No progress bar, no errors.

== Troubleshooting steps
* Update the registry credentials to have the storage.admin permission
* Scan the same repository with the wildcard as before

=== Prisma Cloud version:
All versions are affected.

== Cautionary notes
Wildcard scanning requires more resources and permissions than scanning specific repos, which may not fit your individual use case.
