== Resetting Console's password

If you forgot your Prisma Cloud Console password for a local account in Prisma Cloud, you can reset it.
Follow this procedure with caution because unintended changes to the database can break Console.

To reset the admin password:

[discrete]
==== Prerequisites

* You have root access to the host where Prisma Cloud Console is installed.

[discrete]
==== Procedure

. Create a hash for the password that you wish to use for your local Compute user.
+
In the following example, "Password123" is the desired new password.
+
  $ echo -n Password123 | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 | openssl base64
  AIxwOS46v70PpHu8LtlqqZvUnhWXJ/y6Dy5qvrOp1gE=

. Exec into the Console container.
+
  $ docker exec -ti twistlock_console /bin/bash

. Connect to the database. 
+
  $ mongo
+
If you're using older versions of Compute or Twistlock, the above command may not be sufficient, and you will have to pass in additional arguments:
+
  $ mongo \
    --ssl --sslAllowInvalidHostnames \
    --sslCAFile /var/lib/twistlock/certificates/ca.pem \
    --sslPEMKeyFile /var/lib/twistlock/certificates/client.pem \
    --sslPEMKeyPassword `cat /var/lib/twistlock/certificates/service-parameter`

. Switch to the `twistlock` database and update the local Compute user's password.
+
The following example sets the password for the user "admin" to "Password123".
+
  > use twistlock
  > db.users.update({username:"admin"},{$set: {password:"AIxwOS46v70PpHu8LtlqqZvUnhWXJ/y6Dy5qvrOp1gE="}})
  WriteResult({ "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 })

. Exit out of the database and the container.
+
  > exit
  $ exit

. Verify the changes by logging into Console with your new password.
