== Overview

// <Related Technology>
With effect set to Prevent in your runtime rule, Prisma Cloud actively defends a containerâ€™s file system.  There is a scenario where the runtime file system protection will not prevent, and below will give you some ifnormation on this.



// Give a brief description on what the underlying technology is. For example - Does this relate to aws? or is this a daemonset install issue? Or gcr registry scanning? etc.

== Error messages

// How would the issue appear? If a user wanted to confirm if this issue applied to him, what does he need to look for? Provide step by step procedure
. You would be able to write a new file to a directory outside the active model.
. You would not receive an audit/incident for this


== Steps to confirm the issue

// Anything in logs or on host that the customer would need to check to confirm if it's the same issue?
. On a host where a Defender is deployed, get a shell in a running container.
For this example, assume a container named alpine is already running:
+
  $ docker exec -it alpine sh
+

. Navigate to a folder not in the runtime model and run a simulated file system attack.

  # echo "an attack" >> attack.sh
  sh: can't create attack.sh: Operation not permitted

. Review the audit in *Monitor > Events > Container Audits*.

== Troubleshooting steps

* The https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/compute_edition/runtime_defense/runtime_defense_overview.html#container-models[runtime model] must be *Active* for the running container.
* You must be using a supported storage driver.
Prevent is supported for the https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver[overlay2] and devicemapper storage drivers.
It is not supported for aufs.
If you aren't using overlay2 or devicemapper, set effect to *Alert* or *Block*.
