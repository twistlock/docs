== Overview
Prisma Cloud File Integrity Monitoring feature, continually watches the files and directories in your monitoring profile for changes.  Currently there are a few limitations in this feature that are pointed out below:


== Steps to confirm the issue

. Connect to your host, and create an empty directory.

  $ mkdir /tmp/fim

. Create a File Integrity Monitoring rule.

.. Open Console.

.. Go to *Defend > Runtime > Host Policy*.

.. Click *Add rule*.

.. Enter a rule name, such as *FIM test*.

.. Click the *File Integrity* tab.

.. Click *Add rule*, and fill it in.

$ echo a > /tmp/fim/a
$ cat /tmp/fim/a
$ chmod 0700 /tmp/fim/a
$ echo b > /tmp/fim/b.log
$ echo c > /tmp/fim/c.cache
$ ln -s /bin/sleep /tmp/fim/sleep
$ python -c "open('/tmp/fim/d', 'w+').write('d')"
$ echo e > /tmp/fim/e

== Troubleshooting steps

* There is a 1000 object maximum for watching attribute changes.

* For attribute changes, Prisma Cloud FIM cannot report which user or process made the change.

* For short-lived processes, such as cat, process information, such as the user, might be inconsistent.

* If you create a rule for a path that exists, then delete the path being monitored, the watch mechanism for the path is also deleted.
If you recreate the path, and still want it to be monitored, open the rule, and save it again.
This procedure redeploys the watch mechanism.

* If you create a rule for a path that doesn't exist, no watch mechanism is created, and the error is reported in the Defender log.
After the path is created, open the rule, and save it again.
