== Overview

If your Twistlock Console has been progressively upgraded from version 2.0 (or earlier) to 2.4, you must run the following steps *before* upgrading to 2.5.
This modified upgrade process is required because there are some https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-upgrade-standalone/[prerequisites for upgrading MongoDB].

NOTE: Make sure that you are running Twistlock version 2.4 before running the following steps.


=== Stand alone installations

The following procedure is for Onebox or Console installed with the _twistlock.sh_ script.

[discrete]
==== Procedure

. Exec into your running 2.4.xx Console container.
+
  $ sudo docker exec -ti twistlock_console mongo --ssl --sslAllowInvalidHostnames --sslCAFile /var/lib/twistlock/certificates/ca.pem --sslPEMKeyFile /var/lib/twistlock/certificates/client.pem --sslPEMKeyPassword $(cat /var/lib/twistlock/certificates/service-parameter)

. Verify that the featureCompatibilityVersion is 3.2.
+
  > db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )
  { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.2" }, "ok" : 1 }

. Set the version to 3.4.
+
  > db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )

. Get the version again and verify that it has been changed to 3.4.
+
  > db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )
  { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }, "ok" : 1 }

. Exit the container.
+
  > exit
  # exit


=== Orchestrator installations

If you run Twistlock Console in a cluster, such as Kubernetes or Openshift, then follow these steps before upgrading to 2.5. 

NOTE: If you're upgrading an OpenShift installation, replace _kubectl_ with _oc_ in the following commands.


[discrete]
==== Procedure

. Get the pod name for Console.
+
  $ kubectl get pods -n twistlock
    
. Exec into the Console pod.
+
  $ kubectl exec -ti <twistlock-console-pod> -n twistlock ash

. Verify that the featureCompatibilityVersion is 3.2.
+
  > db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )
  { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.2" }, "ok" : 1 }

. Set the version to 3.4.
+
  > db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )

. Get the version again and verify that it has been changed to 3.4.
+
  > db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )
  { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }, "ok" : 1 }

. Exit the container.
+
  > exit
  # exit

Now you can upgrade to 2.5 version.
For upgrade instructions, see the upgrade instructions in the https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/historical/historical/historical.html[2.5 doc set].
