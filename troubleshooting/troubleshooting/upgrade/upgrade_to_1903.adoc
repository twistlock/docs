== Overview

// https://github.com/twistlock/twistlock/issues/13741

If your Twistlock Console has been progressively upgraded from version 2.4 (or earlier) to 19.03, you must run the following steps *before* upgrading from 18.11 to 19.03.
We've upgraded to MongoDB 4.0 in Twistlock 19.03, which requires that your database's _featureCompatibilityVersion_ must be either 3.6 or 4.0.
You might need to manually update your database's _featureCompatibilityVersion_ to 3.6 before upgrading Twistlock.

Use the following flow chart to help you decide what to do.

For more information, see https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-upgrade-standalone/[MongoDB's upgrade notes].


== Upgrading orchestrator installs

If you run Twistlock Console in a cluster, such as Kubernetes or Openshift, then follow these steps before upgrading to 19.03. 

NOTE: If you're upgrading an OpenShift installation, replace _kubectl_ with _oc_ in the following commands.

==== Procedure

To update your database's _featureCompatibilityVersion_:

. Get the pod name for Console.
+
  $ kubectl get pods -n twistlock
    
. Exec into the Console pod.
+
  $ kubectl exec -ti <twistlock-console-pod> -n twistlock ash

. Verify that the featureCompatibilityVersion is 3.4.
+
  > db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )
  { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }, "ok" : 1 }

. Set the version to 3.6.
+
  > db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" } )

. Get the version again and verify that it has been changed to 3.6.
+
  > db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )
  { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.6" }, "ok" : 1 }

. Exit the container.
+
  > exit
  # exit

Now you can upgrade to 19.03.
For upgrade instructions, see the upgrade instructions in the https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/historical/historical/historical.html[19.03 doc set].
