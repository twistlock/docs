== Overview

Prisma Cloud supports SAML federation with SAML 2.0 compliant Identity Providers.
The steps in the authentication flow between Prisma Cloud and SAML are:

* User browses to the Prisma Cloud Console UI endpoint.

* Prisma Cloud redirects the user's browser sessions to the registered IdP configured in *Manage > Authentication > SAML*
This is known as the *Authentication Request*.

* User authenticates at the IdP's interface.

* The IdP redirects the user's browser back to the Prisma Cloud authentication endpoint (https://CONSOLE:8083/api/v1/authenticate) with the *SAML Response*, which contains a token of claims.
+ 
NOTE: A claim can be attributes of the user (e.g. name, group membership)i, and how they have authenticated.
 
* Prisma Cloud receives the SAML Response from the IdP.

* Prisma Cloud validates the digital signature of the SAML Response.

* Prisma Cloud validates that the Response Token's *Issuer* value matches the *Identity provider issuer* value in the SAML settings for the IdP.

* Prisma Cloud looks for the *groups* claim values and attempts to match the group name in *Manage > Authentication > Groups* that are marked as SAML.

* If the group assignment does not occur, Prisma Cloud attempts to map the *nameid* claim value to SAML users in *Manage > Authentication > Users*.

* If these checks pass, the user is authenticated to Prisma Cloud.
  
  
== Integration issues

The SAML Response can return a status that authentication was denied at the IdP.
Prisma Cloud generates different errors depending on the type of check.

Note that the Chrome browser has a https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/saml-chrome-panel/paijfdbeoenhembfhkhllainmocckace?hl=en[SAML plugin] that's useful for viewing SAML Requests and Responses.


=== "Issuer" doesn't match "Identity provider issuer"

[discrete]
==== Confirm the issue

In Console, go to *Manage > View Logs > Console*, and look for SAML error messages:

  route_handler.go:7926 Operation failed: uri=/api/v1/authenticate; error=failed to check if saml user exists: invalid issuer: https://console.twistlock.com/adfs/services/trust

In your browser, you'll get an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error.

[discrete]
==== Troubleshooting steps

* Look in the SAML Response token for the *Issuer* value, and update the Prisma Cloud configuration.

* The *Audience* value doesn't match the IdP's identifier for the Prisma Cloud Console.


=== Error in IdP

[discrete]
==== Confirm the issue

In Console, go to *Manage > View Logs > Console*, and look for SAML error messages:

  Invalid URI: The format of the URI could not be determined. 

In your browser, the IdP generates an error that says the SP was not identified.

[discrete]
==== Troubleshooting steps

Make sure the *Audience* that the Prisma Cloud Console sends in the AuthenticationRequest matches the IdP's Identifier for the Prisma Cloud SP.


=== Incorrectly loaded SAML Signing Certificate

[discrete]
==== Confirm the issue

In Console, go to *Manage > View Logs > Console*, and look for SAML error messages:

  route_handler.go:7926 Operation failed: uri=/api/v1/authenticate; error=failed to check if saml user exists: func=xmlSecOpenSSLAppCertLoadBIO:file=app.c:line=1286:obj=:subj=PEM_read_bio_X509_AUX:error=4: ; func=xmlSecOpenSSLAppKeyFromCertLoadBIO:file=app.c:line=956:obj=:subj=xmlSecOpenSSLAppCertLoadBIO:error=1: ; func=xmlSecOpenSSLAppKeyLoadBIO:file=app.c:line=366:obj=:subj=xmlSecOpenSSLAppKeyFromCertLoadBIO:error=1: ; func=xmlSecOpenSSLAppKeyLoadMemory:file=app.c:line=237:obj=:subj=xmlSecOpenSSLAppKeyLoadBIO:error=1:

In your browser, you'll get an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error.

[discrete]
==== Troubleshooting steps

There is a problem with the certificate you uploaded to Prisma Cloud Console.
Reload the IdP's Base64 signing certificate into Prisma Cloud.


=== Incorrectly signed SAML Response

[discrete]
==== Confirm the issue

In Console, go to *Manage > View Logs > Console*, and look for SAML error messages:

  route_handler.go:7926 Operation failed: uri=/api/v1/authenticate; error=failed to check if saml user exists: signature verification failed

In your browser, you'll get an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error.

[discrete] 
==== Troubleshooting steps
 
Make sure the IdP is configured to sign the SAML Response or the SAML Response + Assertion.

 
=== Missing nameid attribute

[discrete]
==== Confirm the issue

In Console, go to *Manage > View Logs > Console*, and look for SAML error messages:

  route_handler.go:7926 Operation failed: uri=/api/v1/authenticate; error=invalid credentials*

In your browser, you'll get the following error:

  {"err":"invalid credentials"}

[discrete]
==== Troubleshooting steps

Verify that the SAML user name value in *Manage > Authentication > Users* matches the *nameid* attribute value.
The attribute must be named *nameid*.
    
NOTE: When using ADFS, Active Directory user identity names are case insensitive.
When you use the ADFS SAML provider in Prisma Cloud the *nameid* value will be casted to lowercase values before being compared to the Prisma Cloud user value, which is also casted to lowercase.
If you don't use ADFS, and use a different IdP, such SiteMinder, and it uses Active Directory as the identity authentication source, then the Prisma Cloud user name and nameid values must match.


== Additional information

Currently, there are some limitations when integrating SAML with Prisma Cloud.

* Access to the Prisma Cloud API via SAML authentication is not supported.
There are no HTTP passive redirection capabilities.
Use an API token to access the API for user accounts that have authenticated via SAML.

* SAML Sign Out is not supported yet.
If you have additional questios, reference GitHub issue number #12215 in your correspondence with the support team.

* We do not support SAML Response encryption.
