== Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/20-09/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/welcome/pcee_vs_pcce.html[Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition] is in process for https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/products?sort=productName&productNameSearch=Palo%20Alto%20Networks[FedRAMP Moderate certification].
The Prisma Cloud Compute module is not within the boundaries of this certification and is not available within the FedRAMPed Prisma Cloud Console.
Customers requiring FedRAMP certification should use the self-hosted version, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/welcome/pcee_vs_pcce.html[Prisma Cloud Compute Edition].
For customers offering their own FedRAMP services that use Prisma Cloud Compute to facilitate in their service's FedRAMP certification,
GSA has drafted guidance for the https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/DRAFT_FedRAMP_Vulnerbility_Scanning_Requirements_for_the_Development_and_Use_of_Containers.pdf[FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements for the Deployment and use of Containers].

The configuration settings for Prisma Cloud Compute's features and functions to support an organization's FedRAMP certification can be found link:FedRAMP/fedramp.adoc[here].
