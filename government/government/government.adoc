== Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/20-09/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/welcome/pcee_vs_pcce.html[Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition] is https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/products?sort=productName&productNameSearch=Palo%20Alto%20Networks[FedRAMP Moderate authorized].
The Prisma Cloud Compute module is not within the boundaries of this certification but is available within the FedRAMPed Prisma Cloud Console.
Customers can make the determination if they want to use the Compute module.
Customers requiring FedRAMP certification should use the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/welcome/pcee_vs_pcce.html[self-hosted version].

GSA has published guidance for the https://www.fedramp.gov/2021-03-16-Vulnerability-Scanning-doc/[FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements for Containers].
Customers offering their own FedRAMP services can use Prisma Cloud Compute to facilitate in their service's FedRAMP certification.
The configuration settings for Prisma Cloud Compute's features and functions to support an organization's FedRAMP certification can be found xref:../FedRAMP/fedramp.adoc[here].


== Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)

Prisma Cloud Compute has been assessed to the https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/?_dl_facet_stigs=app-security%2Capp-security-dev[Application Security and Development Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 4, Release: 11 Benchmark Date: 24 Jul 2020].

The findings based upon the vulnerability severity category codes can be found xref:../STIG_ASD_v4_r11/ASD_v4_r11_overview.adoc[here].

== DISA STIG scan findings and justifications for every Prisma Cloud Compute release

Every release of Prisma Cloud Compute we perform an https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol/[SCAP] scan of the Console and Defender images.
The scan is performed with https://www.open-scap.org/[OpenSCAP] using the https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode[Compliance as Code] benchmark checks:

- Benchmark URL: scap-security-guide-<latest>/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
- Benchmark ID: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_benchmark_RHEL-8
- Profile ID: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig

All Prisma Cloud Compute findings are posted xref:../Release_STIG_Findings/release_stig.adoc[here.]

== Upgrade Process for deployments in isolated environments

Some deployments of Prisma Cloud Compute are only provided the updated container images.
The supported and documented https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/compute_edition/upgrade/upgrade_process_self_hosted.html[upgrade process] requires the generation of new Console Deployment and Defender daemonSet yamls.
The tools to perform the required upgrade tasks are posted xref:../isolated_upgrades/isolated_upgrade.adoc[here.]

== DISA STIG Compliance Template
Release v21_04_412 include the Docker Enterprise 2.x Linux/UNIX STIG compliance checks into the “DISA STIG” compliance template.
When you create a new compliance policy and select the DISA STIG compliance template, you will automatically receive alerts based on the checks aligned with the STIG.
The mapping of the STIG_ID to Prisma Cloud Compute Compliance Check ID can be found xref:../Docker_Enterprise_DISA_STIG/docker_stig.adoc[here.]
