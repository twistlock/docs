== Overview

DISA collaborated with Docker, the container platform, to create the https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/stigs/zip/U_Docker_Enterprise_2-x_Linux-UNIX_V2R1_STIG.zip[Docker Enterprise 2.x Linux/UNIX STIG].
The purpose of this STIG is to provide guidance for securing Docker and the supporting Linux and UNIX based operating systems.

=== DISA STIG_ID mapping to Prisma Cloud Compute Compliance Check ID

Eight new compliance checks have been specifically added for the DISA STIG checks, in addition to 49 existing checks that already align with the STIG checks.
The remaining 43 STIG checks are not applicable. For example, STIG ID: DKER-EE-002180, SAML integration, must be enabled in Docker Enterprise Universal Control Plane.
