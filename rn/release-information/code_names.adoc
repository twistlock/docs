== Code names

We often use code names when referring to upcoming releases.
They're convenient to use in things like roadmap presentations and other forward-looking communications.
Code names tend to persist even after a release ships.


=== Version to code name mapping

Version numbers indicate the date a release first shipped, along with the build number, as follows:

<YY>.<MM>.<BUILD-NUMBER>

For example, 20.12.541 is part of the Galileo release, which first shipped in December, 2020.

The following table maps versions to code names.
The table is sorted from newest (top) to oldest release.
