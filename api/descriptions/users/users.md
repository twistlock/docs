Create and manage users.

User management via these endpoints is supported for Compute Edition (self-hosted) only.

If you integrated Prisma Cloud Compute Edition with Active Directory, OpenLDAP, or SAML, use these endpoints to assign roles to individual users.
Note that groups are a better way to assign roles when you have a large number of users.
