Simultaneously updates all code repository rules for your vulnerability policy. 

These rules define potential vulnerabilities caused by your repository's external dependencies so vulnerabilities can be detected long before the code repository is deployed by CI/CD pipelines.

To see where Console invokes this endpoint:

* In Console, use the left menu to navigate to the **Defend** > **Vulnerabilities** screen.
* Within the main content area, navigate to the **Vulnerability rules** section. 
* The endpoint is invoked after you add a rule.

### cURL Request

The following cURL command replaces the vulnerability rules for code repositories.

```bash
$ curl -k \
  -u <USER> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X PUT 'https://<CONSOLE>/api/v1/policies/vulnerability/coderepos?project={PROJECT_NAME}'
  --data '
{
   "rules":[
      {
         "name":"<RULE_NAME>",
         "collections":[
            {
               "name":"<COLLECTION_NAME>",
            }
         ],
         "alertThreshold":{
            "disabled":false,
            "value":0
         },
         "blockThreshold":{
            "enabled":false,
            "value":0
         },
         
         ...
         
      }
   ],
   "policyType": "codeRepoVulnerability"
   
   ...
