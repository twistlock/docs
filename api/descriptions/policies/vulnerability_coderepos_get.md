Retrieves the rules in your vulnerability policy for code repository deployments.

These rules define potential vulnerabilities caused by your repository's external dependencies so that vulnerabilities can be detected long before the code repository is deployed by CI/CD pipelines.

To see where Console invokes this endpoint:

* In Console, use the left menu to navigate to the **Defend** > **Vulnerabilities** screen.
* The endpoint is invoked when the **Code repositories** tab is displayed.
