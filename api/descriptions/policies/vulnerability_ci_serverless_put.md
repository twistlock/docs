Simultaneously updates all the rules in your vulnerability policy for serverless Corporate Identify (CI) deployments. 

To see where Console invokes this endpoint:

* In Console, use the left menu to navigate to the **Defend** > **Vulnerabilities** screen.
* Within the main content area, open **Functions** > **CI**.
* The endpoint is invoked after you add a rule.

This policy targets a your Corporate Identify (CI) pipeline. The policy set in this endpoint targets the scanners in the Jenkins plugin and the `twistcli` command line tool.

**Notes:**

* If your CI is built on Jenkins, a native Jenkins plugin is available.
* If your CI is built on a platform where a native plugin is unavailable (CircleCI, AWS CodeBuild, etc), you can use the `twistcli` command line tool.
