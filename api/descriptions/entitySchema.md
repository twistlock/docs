We provide schemas for all entities referenced in these API docs. Please note that entities might contain different properties than the schema, i.e. they might have additional properties (not documented ones) or might have missing some of the optional properties.

We explicitly document **ONLY** the properties we think should be used by external systems and we will keep compatibility when rolling out new versions of the API. All not documented properties are considered internal for the system and might be subject of change without changing the API version or notification.

This means you **should not use any properties which are not included in the entity schema** as they are considered internal for the system.
