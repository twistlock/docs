== Integrate with PingFederate via SAML 2.0 Federation

Many organizations use SAML to authenticate users for web services.
Prisma Cloud supports the SAML 2.0 federation protocol to access the Prisma Cloud Console.
When SAML support is enabled, administrators can log into the Console with their federated credentials.
This article provides detailed steps for federating your Prisma Cloud Console with your PingFederate v8.4 Identity Provider (IdP).

The Prisma Cloud/PingFederate SAML federation flow works as follows:

. User browses to the Prisma Cloud Console.

. Browser is redirected to PingFederate SAML2.0 endpoint.

. User enters their credentials.

. PingFederate SAML token is returned to the Prisma Cloud Console.

. Prisma Cloud Console validates the PingFederate SAML token's signature and associates the user to their Prisma Cloud account.

. User is directed to the Console Authentication page (Manage > Authentication > Certificates), and is prompted to download their certificate.
Group memberships for the user are embedded in the certificate.

. Using this certificate, user runs a Docker client command on a host protected by Defender.

. Defender uses the certificate to determine the userâ€™s identity and group memberships.
Defender allows or blocks the command, depending on the access policies specified in Console.
+
NOTE: Defender does not talk to the SAML IDP.
Instead, it relies on the user certificate generated from the initial SAML authentication flow, when the user first tries to log into Console.
The validity period for the certificate is controlled by the SAML IDP, which embeds the login expiration into the response.

When Prisma Cloud is integrated with SAML, the logout button in Console works differently than expected.
When you log out Prisma Cloud unregisters your token, but it does not log you out from your SAML provider (because users want to stay signed into their other apps).
Instead, the token is removed and you are redirected back to the login page, which automatically signs you back into Console (assuming that you are still logged into the SAML provider).
Logging out from Console, therefore, essentially refreshes your account information and group memberships.


=== Federation with PingFederate

Prisma Cloud Console is integrated with PingFederate as a federated SAML Service Provider.

* <<Configure PingFederate>>

[.task]
=== Configure PingFederate

[.procedure]
. Logon to PingFederate

. Go to *IdP Configuration > SP Connection > Connection Type*, and select *Browser SSO*.
+

. Go to *IdP Configuration > SP Connection > Connection Options*, and select *Browser SSO Profiles SAML 2.0*.
+
image::ping_saml_step3.png[width=600]

. Skip the *Import Metadata* tab.

. Go to *IdP Configuration > SP Connection > General Info*.

.. In *Partner's Entity ID*, enter *twistlock*.
+
NOTE: By default, the Partner's Entity ID is "twistlock".
When configuring the SAML Audience in the Prisma Cloud Console, the default value is "twistlock". If you choose a different value here, be sure to set the same value in your Console.

.. In *Connection Name*, enter *Prisma Cloud Console*.

.. Click *Add*.
+

. In *Browser SSO > SAML Profiles*, select both *IDP-INITIATED SSO* and *SP-INITIATED SSO*.
+
image::ping_saml_step6.png[width=600]

. Go to *Assertion Creation* and set *SAML_SUBJECT* to *SAML 1.1 nameid-format*.
+
In this example you mapped the user's email address to the SAML_SUBJECT attribute which matches the user's Prisma Cloud account.
If you are using group-to-Prisma Cloud-role associations, add *groups* to the list of attributes to be returned in the SAML token.
+
image::ping_saml_step7.png[width=600]

. In *IdP Configuration > SP Connection > Browser SSO > Protocol Settings > Assertion Consumer Service URL*, specify an assertion consumer URL.

.. Under *Binding*, select *POST*.

.. Under *Endpoint URL*, enter *\https://<FQDN_OF_YOUR_TWISTLOCK_CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/authenticate*.
+
image::ping_saml_step8.png[width=600]

. In *IdP Configuration > SP Connection > Browser SSO > Protocol Settings > Signature Policy*, leave both values unchecked.
+

. In *IdP Configuration > SP Connection > Browser SSO > Protocol Settings*, review the protocol settings.
+
image::ping_saml_step10.png[width=600]

. Click *Done*.

. Copy the PingFederate SAML token signing X.509 certificate as Base64 in *Server Configuration*.
This certificate will be imported into Prisma Cloud Console.


[.task]
=== Configure Prisma Cloud Console

Configure Prisma Cloud Console.

[.procedure]
. Login to the Prisma Cloud Console as an administrator.

. Go to *Manage > Authentication > SAML*.

.. Set *Integrate SAML users and groups with Prisma Cloud* to *Enabled*.

.. Set *Identity Provider* to *Ping*.

.. In *Identity provider single sign-on URL*, enter your PingFederate IdP endpoint.

.. In *Identity provider issuer*, enter your PingFederate Entity ID.

.. In *Audience*, enter *twistlock* (default) or the value set for Partner's Entity ID in PingFederate.

.. In *X.509 certificate*, paste your PingFederate X.509 *Signing Certificate Base64*.

. Click *Save*.


[.task]
=== User account name matching

User account name matching.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Users*.

. Click *Add user*.

. Create a new user:

.. In *Username*, enter the value returned within the SAML_SUBJECT attribute _IdP user's email address_.

.. In *Role*, select the appropriate role.

.. Set *Create user in local Prisma Cloud account database* to *Off*.
+

. Click *Save*.

. Test login into the Prisma Cloud Console via PingFederate SAML federation.
+
Leave your existing session logged onto the Prisma Cloud Console in case you encounter issues.
Open a new in-private browser and go to *\https://<FQDN_OF_YOUR_TWISTLOCK_CONSOLE>:8083*.


[.task]
=== Group name matching

Group name matching.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Groups*.

. Click the *+Add Group* button.

. In the *Name* field, enter a group name.
+
NOTE: The group name must exactly match the group name in the SAML IDP.
Console does not verify if that the value entered matches a group name in the SAML IDP.

. Select the *SAML group* checkbox.
+

Open a new in-private browser and go to *\https://<FQDN_OF_YOUR_TWISTLOCK_CONSOLE>:8083*.


=== Troubleshooting

There is a little trial and error when configuring federation.
If you misconfigure the SAML integration parameters in Prisma Cloud Console, you might get locked out from your Prisma Cloud admin account.
When you try to log into the Prisma Cloud Console to fix the configuration, you might be redirected to the PingFederate login page.

The Prisma Cloud Console provides the ability to logon with a local database account when SAML integration is enabled.
An example of a Prisma Cloud user is the default admin account created when you first install Prisma Cloud.

To login with a Prisma Cloud user account when SAML is enabled, add the URL fragment /#!/login to Console's address.
For example:

  https://<CONSOLE_IPADDR | HOSTNAME>:8083/#!/login

Regular SAML users should log in with the address to Console's front page:

  https://<CONSOLE_IPADDR | HOSTNAME>:8083
