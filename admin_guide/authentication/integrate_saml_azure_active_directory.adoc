== Integrate with Azure Active Directory via SAML 2.0 Federation

Many organizations use SAML to authenticate users for web services.
Prisma Cloud supports the SAML 2.0 federation protocol to access Prisma Cloud Console.
When SAML support is enabled, administrators can log into the Console with their federated credentials.
This article provides detailed steps for federating your Prisma Cloud Console with your Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant's Identity Provider (IdP).

The Prisma Cloud / Azure Active Directory SAML federation workflow is as follows:

. The user browses to Prisma Cloud Console.

. The browser is redirected to the AAD SAML 2.0 endpoint.

. The user enters their AAD credentials.

. The AAD SAML token is returned to Prisma Cloud Console.

. The Prisma Cloud Console validates the Azure Active Directory SAML token's signature and associates the user to their Prisma Cloud account via user identity mapping or group membership.
Prisma Cloud supports SAML groups for Azure Active Directory federation.


When Prisma Cloud is integrated with SAML, the logout button in Console works differently than expected.
When you log out Prisma Cloud unregisters your token, but it does not log you out from your SAML provider (because users want to stay signed into their other apps).
Instead, the token is removed and you are redirected back to the login page, which automatically signs you back into Console (assuming that you are still logged into the SAML provider).
Logging out from Console, therefore, essentially refreshes your account information and group memberships.

NOTE: The Azure Portal may change the Enterprise Application SAML federation workflow over time.
The concepts and steps outlined in this document can be applied to any Non-gallery application.


=== Federation with Azure Active Directory

The Prisma Cloud Console is integrated with Azure Active Directory as a federated SAML Enterprise Application.

+
. On the _jdong-console_ menu select _Single sign-on_ and choose _SAML_
+
image::aad_saml_20200305_1.png[width=600]

. Section #1 _Basic SAML Configuration_:
.. _Identifier_: *jdong-console* (Set to your Console's unique Audience value. You will configure this value within your Console at a later step.)
.. _Reply URL_: *\https://<FQDN_of_your_Prisma Cloud_Console>:8083/api/v1/authenticate*.
+
image::aad_saml_20200305_2.png[width=600]
+
. Section #2 _User Attributes & Claims_:
+
Select the Azure AD user attribute that will be used as the user account name within Prisma Cloud.
This will be the NameID claim within the SAML response token.
We recommend using the default value.
+
.. _Unique User Identifier (Name ID)_: **user.userprincipalname [nameid-format:emailAddress]**
+

=== Prisma Cloud User to AAD User Identity mapping

If you plan to map Azure Active Directory users to Prisma Cloud accounts go to <<Configure Prisma Cloud Console>>.


[.task]
=== Prisma Cloud Groups to AAD Group mapping

When you use Azure Active Directory Groups to map to Prisma Cloud SAML Group, do not create users in Prisma Cloud Console.
Configure the AAD SAML application to send AAD group membership (http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groups) claims within the SAML response token.
If you enable AAD Group authentication the Prisma Cloud User to AAD User Identity method of authentication will be ignored.

[.procedure]
. Set Application permissions:
.. In Azure go to _Azure Active Directory > Application Registrations > jdong-console_
.. Under the _Manage_ section, go to _API Permissions_
.. Click on **Add a Permission**
.. Click on **Microsoft Graph**
.. _Select permissions_: **Application Permissions: Application.Read.All**
+
image::aad_saml_20200305_7.png[width=600]
+
.. Click _Add Permissions_
.. Click _Grant admin consent for Default Directory_ within the Configured permissions blade.

. Create Application Secret
.. Under the Manage section, go to _Certificates & secrets_
.. Click on **New Client secret**
.. Add a _secret description_
.. _Expires_: **Never**
.. Click _Add_
.. Make sure to save the secret _value_ that is generated before closing the blade.
+
image::aad_saml_20200305_8.png[width=600]

. Configure the application to send group claims within the SAML response token.
+
You can configure this setting either within the Azure portal or via powershell.

.. Azure AD Portal:
... Go to _Azure Active Directory > App registrations > jdong-console_
... Click *Manifest*
... Set *"groupMembershipClaims": "SecurityGroup"*
... Click *Save*
+
image::aad_saml_20200305_9.png[width=600]


.. Powershell:
... Use the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/AzureAD/?view=azureadps-2.0[Azure AD] powershell commandlet link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azuread/set-azureadapplication?view=azureadps-2.0[_Set-AzureADApplication_] to configure the application.
... Run the following powershell commands:
+
    import-module AzureAD
    Connect-AzureAD
    $twistlock = Get-AzureADApplication | where-object {$_.DisplayName -eq "jdong-console"}
    $oid = $twistlock.ObjectId
    Set-AzureADApplication -ObjectID $oid -GroupMembershipClaims 1

... Confirm that the _GroupMembershipClaims_ has been set to _SecurityGroup_
+
    $twistlock = Get-AzureADApplication | where-object {$_.DisplayName -eq "jdong-console"}
    $twistlock.GroupMembershipClaims
+
NOTE: Allow several minutes for these permissions to propagate within AAD.


[.task]
=== Configure Prisma Cloud Console

[.task]
=== Prisma Cloud User to AAD User Identity mapping

If you plan to map Azure Active Directory users to Prisma Cloud accounts perform the following steps.

[.procedure]
. Go to _Manage > Authentication > Users_

. Click _Add user_

. _Create a New User_

.. _Username:_ Azure Active Directory _userprincipalname_

.. _Auth Method:_ Select **SAML**

.. _Role:_ Select the appropriate role for the user
+
image::aad_saml_20200305_11.png[width=600]

.. Click *Save*.

. Test logging into Prisma Cloud Console via Azure Active Directory SAML federation.
+
Leave your existing session logged onto Prisma Cloud Console in case you encounter issues.
Open a new in-private browser and go to *\https://<FQDN_of_your_Prisma Cloud_Console>:8083*.


[.task]
==== Prisma Cloud Groups to AAD Group mapping

When you use AAD Groups to assign roles within Prisma Cloud you do not have to create a corresponding Prisma Cloud account.

[.procedure]
. Go to _Manage > Authentication > Groups_
. Click _Add Group_
. Enter the displayname of the AAD group
. Click the _SAML group_ radio button
. Select the Prisma Cloud _role_ for the group
. Click **Save**
+
image::aad_saml_20200305_12.png[width=600]
+
NOTE: Azure Active Directory SAML response will send the user's group membership as OIDs and not the name of the group.
When a group is added, Prisma Cloud Console will query the Microsoft Azure endpoints to determine the OID of the group entered.
Ensure your Prisma Cloud Console is able to reach _\https://login.windows.net/_ and _\https://graph.windows.net_

. Test logging into Prisma Cloud Console via Azure Active Directory SAML federation.
+
Leave your existing session logged into Prisma Cloud Console in case you encounter issues.
Open a new in-private browser and goto *\https://<FQDN_of_your_Prisma Cloud_Console>:8083*.


=== Troubleshooting

If you misconfigure the SAML integration parameters in Prisma Cloud Console, you might get locked out from your Prisma Cloud admin account.
When you try logging into Prisma Cloud Console to fix the configuration, you might be redirected to the Azure Active Directory login page.

The Prisma Cloud Console provides the ability to logon with a local database account when SAML integration is enabled.
An example of a Prisma Cloud user is the default admin account created when you first install Prisma Cloud.

To login with a Prisma Cloud user account when SAML is enabled, add the URL fragment /#!/login to Console's address.
For example:

  https://<CONSOLE_IPADDR | HOSTNAME>:8083/#!/login

Regular SAML users should log in with the address to Console's front page:

  https://<CONSOLE_IPADDR | HOSTNAME>:8083
