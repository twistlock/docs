== Prisma Cloud Compute User Roles 

In Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition, you can assign roles to users to control their level of access to Prisma Cloud.
Roles determine what a user can do and see in Prisma Cloud UI, and the APIs he or she can access.  
These roles are mapped to Compute according to the table below. 


=== Prisma Cloud Roles to Compute Roles mapping

To create roles, go to *Settings >*.
The following table summarizes the roles available in Prisma Cloud and their mapping to Compute Console.

|===

Users with read-only permission to Compute Console only see data from cloud accounts they have access to (in Prisma). 
For example, read-only user John who is assigned access to onboarded accounts from AWS in Prisma Cloud but no access to accounts from GCP and Azure. When John selects the Compute tab, he can only view data coming from Defenders in the assigned AWS account and no other Defenders.
Only system admin permission group users can manage/view data coming from all Defenders in Compute. This includes data from cloud accounts that may not be onboarded in Prisma Cloud.

NOTE: DevOps/CI users only have access to CI/CD scans hence the account filtering mentioned above does not apply to these users. 

NOTE: Only Admin can create collections in Compute. Collections for Read-Only users are visible according to the cloud accounts they are assigned in Prisma Cloud and the subsets of those resources created in manual collections by Admins.
