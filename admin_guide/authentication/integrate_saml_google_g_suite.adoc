=== Setting up Prisma Cloud

To set up Prisma Cloud for G Suite integration:

[.procedure]
. Log into Console, then go to *Manage > Authentication > SAML*.

. Set up the following parameters:

.. Enable *Integrate SAML users and groups with Prisma Cloud*.

.. In *Identity provider*, select *G Suite*.

.. Paste the SSO URL, Entity ID, and certificate that you copied during the G Suite set up (Step 6) into the *Identity Provider single sign-on URL*, *Identity provider issuer*, and *X.509 certificate* fields.

.. Set *Audience* to match the application Entity ID configured in G Suite.
Entity ID was set to *twistlock* in the previous section.

.. Click *Save*.

. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Users*, and click *Add user*.

You will be redirected into G Suite and you might need to enter your credentials.
After that, you will be redirected back into Prisma Cloud and authenticated as a user.


=== Troubleshooting

If anything goes wrong during the setup process, you can always force Console to let you login using the default admin account or any other 'local' user account.

Navigate to \https://<CONSOLE_IPADDR | CONSLE_HOSTNAME>:8083/#!/login, then enter the credentials for your admin account.

From this point, whenever you navigate to Prisma Cloud Console, you will be redirected to G Suite to authenticate.
