== Runtime defense for serverless functions

Prisma Cloud Serverless Defenders protect your serverless functions at runtime.
Currently, Prisma Cloud supports AWS Lambda functions.

Serverless Defenders monitor your functions to ensure they execute as designed.
Per-function policies let you define:

* Process allow and deny lists.
Enables verification of launched subprocesses against policy.

* Outgoing connections allow and deny lists.
Enables verification of domain name resolution against policy for outgoing network connections.


=== Securing serverless functions

To secure an AWS Lambda function, embed the Prisma Cloud Serverless Defender into it.
The steps are:

. Create ZIP file that contains your function source code and dependencies.
. Embed the Serverless Defender into your function and the ZIP archive.
. Upload the updated ZIP file to AWS.


=== Sample function

You can use the following Python 3.6 sample function to test Prisma Cloud's Serverless Defender.
The function is set up to be easily exploited with a command injection attack.

The function reads the request body.
If the request body is empty, it returns a response of OK.
If the request body contains data, the data is assumed to be a shell command, and it's summarily executed as a child program in a new process.

[source,python]
----
import subprocess
import os
import json

def handler(event, context):

    # Read the request body.
    if "body" in event:
        cmd = event["body"]
    else:
        cmd = None

    # Prepare the default response.
    response = {
      "isBase64Encoded": False,
      "statusCode": 200,
      "headers": {"Content-Type": "text/plain"},
      "body": "OK\n"
    }

    # If the request body contains a string,
    # execute it as a command in a new process.
    if cmd is not None:
        try:
            p = subprocess.Popen(cmd.split(" "), stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
            out, _ = p.communicate()
            out = out.decode("utf8")
        except Exception as e:
            out = str(e)

        response['body'] = out

    return response

=== Creating an AWS Lambda function

Create an AWS Lambda function, then add an API Gateway so that you can trigger it with HTTP requests.
This section is geared to setting up the sample function.
If you've already got your own function, verify that it satisfies the prerequisites, then proceed to the next section.

*Prerequisites:*
* Your function is written for Node.js 10.x or Python 3.6.
* Your function's execution role grants it permission to write to CloudWatch Logs.

[.procedure]
. Log into the AWS Management Console.

. Go to *Services > Compute > Lambda*.

. Click *Create function*.

.. Select *Author from scratch*.

.. Enter a function name.

.. Select a runtime.
If you're using the sample function, select Python 3.6.

.. Select a role.
+
Prisma Cloud Serverless Defender requires permission to write to CloudWatch Logs.
The simplest way to do this is to attach the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole and attaching it to the role you create for your Lambda function.
The AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole only grants permission to write to CloudWatch Logs.
Use this policy if your Lambda function does not access any other AWS resources except writing logs.

.. Click *Create function*

. Add a trigger to execute your function.

.. Under *Add triggers*, click *API Gateway*.

.. In *Configure triggers*, set *API* to *Create a new API*.

.. Then set *Security* to *Open*.

.. Click *Add*.
+
image::serverless_config_api_gateway.png[width=800]

.. Click *Save*.
+
image::serverless_save.png[width=100]

.. Expand *Details*, copy the invoke URL, and set it aside.
You'll use it later to test your function.

[.task]
=== Defining your policy

Define your policy in Prisma Cloud Console before embedding the Serverless Defender into your function.
The embed process retrieves the relevant policy from Console and adds it the function's ZIP file, where Serverless Defender can read it and enforce it.
By default, there are no rules in the serverless runtime policy, so be sure to create at least one rule.

In this procedure, you create a new rule that prevents all processes, besides the main process, from running.
By default, new rules apply to all functions (`*`), but you can target them to specific functions using xref:../configure/rule_ordering_pattern_matching.adoc#[pattern matching].

This procedure demonstrates how to block command injection in the sample function.
If you've got your own function, configure the rule to meet your own specific objectives.

[.procedure]
. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Defend > Runtime > Serverless Policy*.

. Click *Add rule*.

.. Enter a rule name.

.. Click the *Processes* tab.

.. Set *Effect* to *Prevent*.
+
To explicitly allow or deny specific processes, set *Block all processes except main process* to *Off*.

.. Click *Save*.

=== Embedding the Serverless Defender from the Console UI

You can embed the Serverless Defender into your function from the Console UI.
Use this method when you are testing Serverless Defender or you have just a handful of functions.
If you have a lot of functions, use twistcli to automate the embed process.

[.procedure]
. Export your function from AWS as a ZIP file.

.. From Lambda's code editor, click *Actions > Export function*.

.. Click *Download deployment package*.
Your function is downloaded to your host as a ZIP file.

. Open Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Deploy*.

. Embed Serverless Defender into your function.

.. Choose the DNS name or IP address Serverless Defender uses to connect to Console.

.. In *Choose Defender type*, select *Serverless*.

.. In *Embed serverless Defender*, specify all your function's details, then choose the ZIP file to upload.

.. Click *Create Embedded ZIP*.
Serverless Defender is embedded in your function, and it is downloaded to your host.

. Upload the new ZIP file to AWS.

.. In *Designer*, select your function so that you can view the function code.

.. Under *Code entry type*, select *Upload a .ZIP file*.

.. Specify a runtime and the handler.
+
If you're using the sample function, validate that *Runtime* is *Python 3.6*, and set *Handler* to *main.handler*.

.. Click *Upload*.

[.task]
=== Embedding the Serverless Defender with twistcli

This method for embedding the Serverless Defender was designed to seamlessly integrate into the CI/CD pipeline.
There is a clean separation between the code developers produce from the functions we protect.
Developers don't need to change their code to accomodate Prisma Cloud.
They don't need to load any special libraries, add any files, or change any manifests.
When the code is ready to be deployed to test or production, run twistcli to automatically embed Serverless Defender into the function, then leverage AWS tools to tag, version, and upgrade your functions.

Your pipeline will probably call twistcli twice: once to xref:../vulnerability_management/serverless_functions.adoc#[scan the image for vulnerabilities], and then later in the pipeline to embed Serverless Defender.
Be sure to use a naming scheme that clearly delineates protected and unprotected functions.

[.procedure]
. Save the example code to your local machine as _main.py_.

. Zip the code.
The following command creates a ZIP file named lambda.zip

  $ zip lambda main.py

. Embed the serverless Defender..
The following command generates a new ZIP file named _twistlock_lambda.zip_.

  $ ./twistcli serverless embed \
    --address https://<TWISTLOCK_CONSOLE>:8083 \
    --user <TWISTLOCK_CONSOLE_USER>
    --function <AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME>
    --runtime python3.6
    --handler main.handler
    lambda.zip

. Review the contents of the new ZIP file.
There is a new directory named _twistlock/_ that holds the policy (_config_) and the Serverless Defender (_libtw_serverless.so_).

  $ zipinfo twistlock_lambda.zip
  Archive:  twistlock_lambda.zip
  Zip file size: 20036 bytes, number of entries: 5
  -r--r--r--  2.0 unx      624 bX defN 18-Jul-28 10:08 main.py
  drwxr-xr-x  2.0 unx        0 bX stor 18-Jul-28 10:08 twistlock/
  -rw-r--r--  2.0 unx      208 bX defN 18-Jul-28 10:08 twistlock/config
  -r--r--r--  2.0 unx    46136 bX defN 18-Jul-28 10:08 twistlock/libtw_serverless.so
  -r--r--r--  2.0 unx      123 bX defN 18-Jul-28 10:08 twistlock/serverless.py
  5 files, 47091 bytes uncompressed, 19294 bytes compressed:  59.0%

. Upload the new ZIP file to AWS.

.. In *Designer*, select your function so that you can view the function code.

.. Under *Code entry type*, select *Upload a .ZIP file*.

.. Specify a runtime and the handler.
+
If you're using the sample function, validate that *Runtime* is *Python 3.6*, and set *Handler* to *main.handler*.

.. Click *Upload*.
+

//If you review the function code, you can see a single update.


[.task]
=== Testing the function

Trigger your function and view the results.
First trigger the function to run 'normally'.
Then trigger with function with a command injection attack.

[.procedure]
. Run the GET method on your endpoint.
It should return normally.

  $ curl -X GET <API_GATEWAY_INVOKE_URL>
  OK

. Run a POST method on your endpoint, submitting the command to run in the request body:

  $ curl -X POST <API_GATEWAY_INVOKE_URL> \
    --data '/bin/ls -l'
  [Errno 13] Permission denied

. To view the CloudWatch logs, click *Monitoring*, click *View logs in CloudWatch*.
