== Data exfiltration

Data exfiltration is the anauthorized transfer of data from one system to another.

Data exfiltration incidents are triggered when a pattern of audits indicate attempts to move data to an external location.  

=== Investigation

The following screenshot shows a data exfiltration incident.
Two audits, taken together, indicate that:

* This container used DNS to resolve ix.io, a website similar to pastebin.com, that lets users upload text.
* An outbound connection was made to an IP address.

NOTE: In order for Prisma Cloud to learn and model the names a container resolves during the course of normal operation and to detect the resolution of known bad domains, you must enable DNS monitoring in your runtime network rules.
DNS monitoring is not currently supported on Docker Swarm.

As a first step, itâ€™s important to validate whether these factors (IP and DNS name, in this case) can be explained by expected behavior.
Using a search on virustotal.com, or similar service, you can determine that the IP address is associated with ix.io.
Since it is highly unusual for a production service to use a service such as this, it is safe to assume that this is a bona fide security incident.

The next step is to review other audits in this timeframe:

A review of the audit log shows that a system file, _/etc/group_, was copied and posted to ix.io using curl.
It is likely that this is part of a larger incident.

The next step is to determine how the actor was able to access and exfiltrate data.
There may be additional incidents generated that shed light on this question.
For example, hijacked process and lateral movement incidents from this source or related sources might have transpired just before this incident.

If there are no clues in other logged incidents, some other potential avenues of investigation include:

* Review Docker access logs in Prisma Cloud (if enabled) to determine if execution was initiated from the host.
* Review Docker logs for the container.
* Review available application logs.

=== Mitigation

The first step in mitigating the exfiltration of data is to determine the content and sensitivity of data potentially affected.

* If the data represents critical system information, such as stored secrets, take the appropriate action to protect potentially exposed systems.
* If the data represents sensitive data such as PII, take the appropriate steps as specified by policy and recommended by legal counsel.

In the longer-term, implementing runtime rules to prevent or block anomalous behavior can help to contain future attempts at data exfiltration.
