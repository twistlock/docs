== Install a single Container Defender

Single Container Defenders are installed with a curl-bash script.
Install Container Defender on each host that you want Prisma Cloud to protect.

*Prerequisites*:

* Your system meets all minimum
xref:../../install/system_requirements.adoc[system requirements].
* You have already xref:../../install/getting_started.adoc[installed Console], and it can be accessed over the network from the host where you want to install Defender.
* Ports 8083 and 8084 are open on the host where Console runs.
* Port 8084 is open on the host where Defender runs.
Console and Defender communicate with each other over a web socket on port 8084 (by default the communication port is set to 8084 - however, you can specify your own custom port when deploying a Defender).
* You have sudo access to the host where Defender will be installed.

[.procedure]
. Verify that the host machine where you install Defender can connect to Console.

  $ curl -sk -D - https://<CONSOLE_IP_ADDRESS|HOSTNAME>:8083/api/v1/_ping
+
If curl returns an HTTP response status code of 200, you have connectivity to Console.
If you customized the setup when you installed Console, you might need to specify a different port.

. Log into Console.

. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Deploy*.

.. In the first drop-down menu (2), select the way Defender connects to Console.
+
A list of IP addresses and hostnames are pre-populated in the drop-down list.
If none of the items are valid, go to *Manage > Defenders > Names*, and add a new Subject Alternative Name (SAN) to Console's certificate.
After adding a SAN, your IP address or hostname will be available in the drop-down list.
+
NOTE: Selecting an IP address in a evaluation setup is acceptable, but using a DNS name is more resilient.
If you select Console's IP address, and Console's IP address changes, your Defenders will no longer be able to communicate with Console.

.. (Optional) Set a proxy (3) for the Defender to use for the communication with the Console.

.. (Optional) Set a custom communication port (4) for the Defender to use.

.. In the second drop-down list (5), select the xref:../../install/defender_types.adoc#[Defender type].
Both Linux and Windows platforms are supported.

.. In the second drop-down list (5), select the xref:../../install/defender_types.adoc#[Defender type].
Both Linux and Windows platforms are supported.

.. In the third drop-down list (6), leave the xref:../../access_control/rbac.adoc#_defender_listener_type[listener type] set to *None*.

.. In the final field (7), copy the install command, which is generated according to the options you selected.

. On the host where you want to install Defender, paste the command into a shell window, and run it.


[.task]
=== Verify the install

Verify that Defender is installed and connected to Console.

NOTE: Defender can be deployed and run with full functionality when dockerd is configured with SELinux enabled (--selinux-enabled=true).
All features will work normally and without any additional configuration steps required.
Prisma Cloud automatically detects the SELinux configuration on a per-host basis and self-configures itself as needed.
No action is needed from the user.

// It would be useful to add a troubleshooting section here.
// First step: Go to the host, and validate that the Defender container is actually running.
// Need to provide steps for each Defender type (Linux Server, Windows Server, Windows Container Host).
// Verify that Defender is running on the host.
//
//  $ docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Status}}" | grep defender
//  twistlock_defender: Up 7 minutes

[.procedure]
. In Console, go to *Manage > Defenders > Manage*.
+
Your new Defender should be listed in the table, and the status box should be green and checked.
