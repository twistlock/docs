== Amazon ECS

ifdef::compute_edition[]
This quickstart guide shows you how to deploy Prisma Cloud on a simple cluster that has a single infrastructure node and two worker nodes.
Console runs on the infrastructure node, and an instance of Defender runs on each of the worker nodes.

Console is the Prisma Cloud management interface, and it runs as a service.
The parameters of the service are described in a task definition, and the task definition is written in JSON format.

Defender protects your containerized environment according to the policies you set in Console.

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]

This quickstart guide shows you how to deploy Prisma Cloud defenders on a simple cluster that has two worker nodes.

Defender protects your containerized environment according to the policies you set in Prisma Cloud Console.
endif::prisma_cloud[]

To automatically deploy an instance of Defender on each worker node in your cluster, you will use a user data script in the worker node launch configuration.
User data scripts run custom configuration commands when a new instance is started.
You will set up the user data script to call the Prisma Cloud API to download, install, and start Defender.

NOTE: This guide assumes you know very little about AWS ECS.
As such, it is extremely prescriptive.
If you are already familiar with AWS ECS and do not need assistance navigating the interface, simply read the section synopsis, which summarizes all key configurations.

ifdef::compute_edition[]

The installation described in this article is meant to be "production grade" in that data is persisted across restarts of the nodes.
If an infrastructure node were to go down, ECS should be able to reschedule the Console service on any healthy node, and Console should still have access to its state.
To enable this capability, you must attach storage that is accessible from each of your infrastructure nodes, and Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is an excellent choice.

When you have more than one infrastructure node, ECS can run Console on any one of them.
Defenders need a reliable way to connect to Console, no matter where it runs.
A load balancer automatically directs traffic to the the node where Console runs, and offers a stable interface that Defenders can use to connect to Console and that operators can use to access its web interface.

NOTE: We assume you are deploying Prisma Cloud to the default VPC.
If you are not using the default VPC, adjust your settings accordingly.

=== Create an EFS file system for Console

Create the Console EFS file system, then capture the mount command that will be used to mount the file system on every infrastructure node.

*Prerequisites:*

// More info about these min requirements: https://twistlock.desk.com/agent/case/3848

Prisma Cloud Console depends on an EFS file system with the following performance characteristics:

* *Performance mode:* General purpose.
* *Throughput mode:* Provisioned.
Provision 0.1 MiB/s per deployed Defender.
For example, if you plan to deploy 10 Defenders, provision 1 MiB/s of throughput.

NOTE: The EFS file system and ECS cluster must be in the same VPC and security group.

[.procedure]
. Log into the AWS Management Console.

. Go to *Services > Storage > EFS*.

. Click *Create File System*.

. Select a VPC, select the *pc-security-group* for each mount target, then click *Next Step*.

. Enter a value for Name, such as *pc-efs-console*

. Set your throughput mode to *Provisioned*, and adjust Throughput to 0.1 MiB/s per Defender that would be deployed. Click *Next Step*.
