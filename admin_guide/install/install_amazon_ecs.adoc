== Amazon ECS

This quickstart guide shows you how to deploy Prisma Cloud on a simple cluster that has a single infrastructure node and two worker nodes.
Console runs on the infrastructure node, and an instance of Defender runs on each of the worker nodes.

Console is the Prisma Cloud management interface, and it runs as a service.
The parameters of the service are described in a task definition, and the task definition is written in JSON format.

Defender protects your containerized environment according to the policies you set in Console.
To automatically deploy an instance of Defender on each worker node in your cluster, you will use a user data script in the worker node launch configuration.
User data scripts run custom configuration commands when a new instance is started.
You will set up the user data script to call the Prisma Cloud API to download, install, and start Defender.

NOTE: This guide assumes you know very little about AWS ECS.
As such, it is extremely prescriptive.
If you are already familiar with AWS ECS and do not need assistance navigating the interface, simply read the section synopsis, which summarizes all key configurations.

The installation described in this article is meant to be "production grade" in that data is persisted across restarts of the nodes.
If an infrastructure node were to go down, ECS should be able to reschedule the Console service on any healthy node, and Console should still have access to its state.
To enable this capability, you must attach storage that is accessible from each of your infrastructure nodes, and Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is an excellent choice.

When you have more than one infrastructure node, ECS can run Console on any one of them.
Defenders need a reliable way to connect to Console, no matter where it runs.
A load balancer automatically directs traffic to the the node where Console runs, and offers a stable interface that Defenders can use to connect to Console and that operators can use to access its web interface.

NOTE: We assume you are deploying Prisma Cloud to the default VPC.
If you are not using the default VPC, adjust your settings accordingly.


=== Key identifiers

There are a number of AWS resource identifiers that are used throughout the install procedure.
The important ones are highlighted here.

*Cluster name*: _tw-ecs-cluster_

*Security group*: _tw-security-group_

*Infrastructure node's IP address*: _<ECS_INFRA_NODE>_ (Retrieve this value from the AWS Management Console after the infrastructure EC2 instance starts.)

*Console task definition*: _tw-console_ (This value is specified in the task definition JSON.)


[.task]
=== Download the Prisma Cloud software

The Prisma Cloud release tarball contains all the release artifacts.

[.procedure]
. Go to the xref:../welcome/releases.adoc[Releases] page, and copy the link to current recommended release.

. Retrieve the release tarball.

  $ wget <LINK_TO_CURRENT_RECOMMENDED_RELEASE_LINK>

. Unpack the Prisma Cloud release tarball.

  $ mkdir twistlock
  $ tar xvzf twistlock_<VERSION>.tar.gz  -C twistlock/


[.task]

+
You will use this mount command to configure your launch configuration for the Defenders.


=== Deploy Console

Launch an infrastructure node that runs in the cluster, then start Prisma Cloud Console as a service on that node.


[.task]
==== Create a launch configuration for the infrastructure node

Launch configurations are templates that are used by an auto-scaling group to start EC2 instances in your cluster.

Create a launch configuration named _tw-infra-node_ that:

* Creates an instance type of t2.large, or higher.
For more information about Console's minimum requirements, see
xref:../install/system_requirements.adoc[System requirements].
* Runs Amazon ECS-Optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
* Uses the ecsInstanceRole IAM role.
* Runs a user data script that joins the _tw-ecs-cluster_ and defines a custom attribute named _purpose_ with a value of _infra_.
Console will be pinned to this instance.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Services > Compute > EC2*.

. In the left menu, click *AUTO SCALING > Launch Configurations*.

. Click *Create launch configuration*.

. Choose an AMI.

.. Click *AWS Marketplace*.

ECS_CLUSTER=tw-ecs-cluster
ECS_INSTANCE_ATTRIBUTES={"purpose": "infra"}
EOF

yum install -y nfs-utils
mkdir /twistlock_console
<CONSOLE_MOUNT_COMMAND> /twistlock_console

----
+
_ECS_CLUSTER_ must match your cluster name.
If you've named your cluster something other than _tw_ecs_cluster_, then modify your User Data script accordingly.
+
_<CONSOLE_MOUNT_COMMAND>_ is the Console mount command you copied from the AWS Management Console after creating your EFS file system.
The mount target must be _/twistlock_console_, not the _efs_ mount target provided in the sample command.
+

.. (Optional) Under *IP Address Type*, select *Assign a public IP address to every instance*.
+
With this option, you can easily SSH to this instance to troubleshoot issues.

.. Click *Next: Add Storage*.

[.task]
==== Copy the Prisma Cloud config file into place

The Prisma Cloud API serves the version of the configuration file used to instantiate Console.
Use scp to copy _twistlock.cfg_ from the Prisma Cloud release tarball to _/twistlock_console/var/lib/twistlock-config_ on the infrastructure node.

[.procedure]
. Upload _twistlock.cfg_ to the infrastructure node.

.. Go to the directory where you unpacked the Prisma Cloud release tarball.

.. Copy _twistlock.cfg_ to the infrastructure node.

   $ scp -i <PATH-TO-KEY-FILE> twistlock.cfg ec2-user@<ECS_INFRA_NODE>:~

. SSH to the infrastructure node.

  $ ssh -i <PATH-TO-KEY-FILE> ec2-user@<ECS_INFRA_NODE>

. Copy the _twistlock.cfg_ file into place.

  $ sudo cp twistlock.cfg /twistlock_console/var/lib/twistlock-config

[.task]
==== Create a Prisma Cloud Console task definition

Prisma Cloud provides a task definition template for Console.
Download the template, then update the variables specific to your environment.
Finally, load the task definition in ECS.

*Prerequisites:*

* The task definition provisions sufficient resources for Console to operate.
Our template specifies reasonable defaults.
For more information, see xref:../install/system_requirements.adoc#[System requirements].

[.procedure]
. Download the https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/attachments/amazon-ecs-task-tw-console.json[Prisma Cloud Console task definition], and open it for editing.

. Update the value for `image` to point to Prisma Cloud's cloud registry.
+
Replace the following placeholder strings with the appropriate values:
+
* `<ACCESS-TOKEN>` --
Your Prisma Cloud access token.
All characters must be lowercase.
To convert your access token to lowercase, run:
+
  $ echo <ACCESS-TOKEN> | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'

* `<VERSION>` --
Version of the Console image to retrieve and install.
For example, `18_11_128`.

. Update the value for `CONSOLE_SAN` to the DNS name and/or IP address for your infra node.

. Go to *Services > Containers > Elastic Container Service*.

. In the left menu, click *Task Definitions*.

. Click *Create new Task Definition*.

. In *Step 1: Select launch type compatibility*, select *EC2*, then click *Next step*.

. In *Step 2: Configure task and container definitions*, scroll to the bottom of the page and click *Configure via JSON*.

. Delete the contents of the window, and replace it with the Prisma Cloud Console task definition

. Click *Save*.

.. (Optional) Change the task definition name before creating. The JSON will default the name to *tw-console*.

. Click *Create*.


[.task]
==== Launch the Prisma Cloud Console service

Create the Console service using the previously defined task definition.
A single instance of Console will run on the infrastructure node.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Services > Containers > Elastic Container Service*.

. In the left menu, click *Clusters*.

. Click on your cluster.

. In the *Services* tab, then click *Create*.

. In *Step 1: Configure service*:

.. For *Launch type*, select *EC2*.

.. For *Task Definition*, select *tw-console*.

.. In *Service Name*, enter *tw-console*.

.. In *Number of tasks*, enter *1*.

.. Click *Next Step*.

. In *Step 2: Configure network*, accept the defaults, and click *Next*.

. In *Step 3: Set Auto Scaling*, accept the defaults, and click *Next*.

. Click *View Service*.


[.task]
==== Configure Prisma Cloud Console

Navigate to Console's web interface, create your first admin account, then enter your license.

[.procedure]
. Start a browser, then navigate to \https://<ECS_INFRA_NODE>:8083

. At the login page, create your first admin account.
Enter a username and password.

. Enter your license key, then click *Register*.


[.task]
==== Set up a load balancer and Target Group

After you deploy Console, set up Amazon Network Load Balancers (NLB).
You should use a *network* load balancer.

You'll create two load balancer listeners.
One is used for Console's UI and API, which are served on port 8083.
Another is used for the websocket connection between Defender and Console, which is established on port 8084.

For detailed instructions on how to create an NLB load balancer for Console, please refer to our xref:../howto/configure_aws_nlb.adoc[Configure an AWS Network Load Balancer] article. 

*Prerequisites:*

* Console is fully operational.
You have created your first admin user, entered your license, and you can access Console's web interface.

[.procedure]
. Copy the DNS name for your load balancer and set it aside.
You will need it to configure the launch configuration for your worker nodes.

. Add the DNS names for your load balancers to the Subject Alternative Name field in Console's certificate.
+
Log into Prisma Cloud Console, go to *Manage > Defenders > Names*, and add the DNS names for your load balancers to the *Subject Alternative Name* table.


=== Deploy Defender

After deploying Console, you are now ready to deploy your worker nodes.
You will create an ECS Task Definition for the Prisma Cloud Defender, then create a service of type Daemon to ensure that the Defender is deployed across your ECS cluster.
For this reason, it is imperative that Console be fully operational before worker nodes are instantiated in the cluster.


[.task]
==== Copy Defender's certificates into place

Get the certificates Defender requires to securely connect to Console, and then copy them to the EFS partition that worker nodes will mount.

[.procedure]
. Retrieve the service parameter from the Prisma Cloud API.

  $ curl -k -s \
    -u <USER> \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X GET \
    https://<CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/certs/service-parameter \
    -o service-parameter
+
NOTE: <CONSOLE> is the address the curl command uses to access Console.

. Retrieve the certificate bundle from the Prisma Cloud API, and save it to a file.
It's returned as a base64 string.
+
Depending on the Console version the API call will be different.  
+
For Console version 19.11.480:
+
  $ curl -k -s \
    -u <USER> \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X GET \
    https://<CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/defenders/install-bundle?consoleaddr=<CONSOLE_CONN>&defenderType=rasp \
    | jq -r '.installBundle' > INSTALL_BUNDLE
+
For Console versions greater than or equal to 19.11.506:
+
  $ curl -k -s \
    -u <USER> \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X GET \
    https://<CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/defenders/install-bundle?consoleaddr=<CONSOLE_CONN>&defenderType=appEmbedded \
    | jq -r '.installBundle' > INSTALL_BUNDLE
+
NOTE: <CONSOLE_CONN> is the address the Defenders use to connect to the Console.
Use the address of your load balancer.

. Using the output from the previous command, decode the base64 string into each of the three separate files: _ca.pem_, _client-cert.pem_, and _client-key.pem_.
This following command also replaces the _\n_ values in the output to UNIX-style line endings.

  $ for file in "ca.pem" "client-cert.pem" "client-key.pem"; \
     do cat INSTALL_BUNDLE | base64 --decode \
     | jq --arg i "$file" -r '.secrets[$i]' \
     | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n")}1' > $file; \
     done

. Copy the certs into place.

.. Mount the Defender EFS file system temporarily on a system of your choosing.
Use the mount command you saved when you created your EFS file system.

.. Copy the following files to the EFS file system:
+
* service-parameter
* ca.pem
* client-cert.pem
* client-key.pem

.. Set the ownership and permissions for each file.

  $ chown root:root ca.pem client-cert.pem client-key.pem service-parameter
  $ chmod 600 ca.pem client-cert.pem client-key.pem service-parameter

.. Unmount the EFS file system.

   $ umount <filesystem>

[.task]
==== Create a launch configuration for worker nodes

Create a launch configuration named _tw-worker-node_ that:

* Runs the Amazon ECS-Optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

yum install -y nfs-utils
mkdir /twistlock_certificates
chown root:root /twistlock_certificates
chmod 700 /twistlock_certificates
<DEFENDER_MOUNT_COMMAND> /twistlock_certificates
----
+
Where:
+
* _ECS_CLUSTER_ must match your cluster name.
If you've named your cluster something other than _tw_ecs_cluster_, then modify your User Data script accordingly.

* _<DEFENDER_MOUNT_COMMAND>_ is the mount command you copied from the AWS Management Console after creating your Defender EFS file system.
The mount target must be _/twistlock_certificates_, replacing the _efs_ mount target provided in the sample mount command.

. Go to *Services > Storage > EFS*.

. Click *Create File System*.

. Select a VPC, select the *tw-security-group* for each mount target, then click *Next*.

. Enter a value for Name, such as *tw-nlb-defender*, then click *Next*.

. Review your settings and create the file system.

. Click on the *Amazon EC2 mount instructions (from local VPC)* link and copy the mount command (Using the NFS client) and set it aside as the Defender mount command.
+
You will use this mount command to configure your launch configuration for the Defenders.


=== Deploy Defender

Deploy your worker nodes.
You will create an ECS Task Definition for the Prisma Cloud Defender, then create a service of type Daemon to ensure that the Defender is deployed across your ECS cluster.
For this reason, it is imperative that Console be fully operational before worker nodes are instantiated in the cluster.


[.task]
==== Copy the service-parameter into place

Download the _service-parameter_ from the Console API and copy it to the EFS partition that worker nodes will mount.

[.procedure]
. Retrieve Console's API address (CONSOLE).

.. Sign into Prisma Cloud.

.. Go to *Compute > Manage > System > Downloads*.

.. Copy the URL under *Path to Console*.

. Retrieve the service parameter from the Prisma Cloud API.

  $ curl -k \
    -u <USER> \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X GET \
    <CONSOLE>/api/v1/certs/service-parameter \
    -o service-parameter
+
NOTE: <CONSOLE> is the address the curl command uses to access Console.

. Copy the _service-parameter_ to the EFS file system.

.. Mount the Defender EFS file system temporarily on a system of your choosing.
Use the mount command you saved when you created your EFS file system.

.. Copy the following files to the EFS file system:
+
* service-parameter

.. Set the ownership and permissions for each file.

  $ chown root:root service-parameter
  $ chmod 600 service-parameter

.. Unmount the EFS file system.

   $ umount <filesystem>


[.task]
==== Copy the INSTALL_BUNDLE into place

Copy the INSTALL_BUNDLE into place.

[.procedure]
. Retrieve the certificate bundle from the Prisma Cloud API, and save it to a file.
It's returned as a base64 string.

  $ curl -k \
    -u <USER> \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X GET \
    <CONSOLE>/api/v1/defenders/install-bundle?consoleaddr=<CONSOLE_CONN> \
    | jq -r '.installBundle' 
+
NOTE: <CONSOLE_CONN> is the address the Defenders use to connect to the Console.
The service address can be derived from the API address by removing the protocol scheme and path.
It is simply the host part of the URL.
For example: <REGION>.cloud.twistlock.com

. Save the _installBundle_ output, as you will need it later to populate the task definition.


[.task]
==== Create a launch configuration for worker nodes

Create a launch configuration named _tw-worker-node_ that:

* Runs the Amazon ECS-Optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
* Uses the ecsInstanceRole IAM role.
* Runs a user data script that joins the tw-ecs-cluster and runs the commands required to install Defender.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Services > Compute > EC2*.

. In the left menu, click *AUTO SCALING > Launch Configurations*.

. Click *Create launch configuration*.

. Choose an AMI.

.. Click *AWS Marketplace*.

.. In the search box, enter *Amazon ECS-Optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI*.

.. Click *Select* for *Amazon ECS-Optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI*.

. Choose an instance type.

.. Select *t2.medium*.

.. Click *Next: Configure details*.

. Configure details.

.. In *Name*, enter a name for your launch configuration, such as *tw-worker-node*.

.. In *IAM* role, select *ecsInstanceRole*.

.. Select *Monitoring*.

.. Expand *Advanced Details*,

.. In *User Data*, enter the following text:
+
[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo ECS_CLUSTER=tw-ecs-cluster >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config

yum install -y nfs-utils
mkdir /twistlock_certificates
chown root:root /twistlock_certificates
chmod 700 /twistlock_certificates
<DEFENDER_MOUNT_COMMAND> /twistlock_certificates
----
+
Where:
+
* _ECS_CLUSTER_ must match your cluster name.
If you've named your cluster something other than _tw_ecs_cluster_, then modify your User Data script accordingly.

* _<DEFENDER_MOUNT_COMMAND>_ is the mount command you copied from the AWS Management Console after creating your Defender EFS file system.
The mount target must be _/twistlock_certificates_, replacing the _efs_ mount target provided in the sample mount command.

.. (Optional) Under *IP Address Type*, select *Assign a public IP address to every instance*.
+
With this option, you can easily SSH to any worker node instance and troubleshoot issues.

.. Click *Next: Add Storage*.

. Add Storage.

.. Accept the defaults, and click *Next: Configure Security Group*.

. Configure security group.

.. Under *Assign a security group*, choose *Select an existing security group*.

.. Select *tw-security-group*.

.. Click *Review*.

. Review.

.. Click *Create launch configuration*.


[.task]
==== Create an auto scaling group for the worker nodes

Launch two worker nodes into your cluster.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Services > Compute > EC2*.

. In the left menu, click *AUTO SCALING > Auto Scaling Groups*.

. Click *Create Auto Scaling group*.

. Select *Create an Auto Scaling group from an existing launch configuration*.

. Select *tw-worker-node*.

. Click *Next Step*.

. Configure Auto Scaling group details.

.. In *Group Name*, enter tw-worker-autoscaling.

.. Leave *Group size* set to *2*.

.. Under *Network*, select your default VPC.

.. Under *Subnet*, select a public subnet, such as 172.31.0.0/20.

.. Click *Next: Configure scaling policies*.

. Configure scaling policies.

.. Select *Keep this group at its initial size*.

.. Click *Next: Configure Notifications*.

. Configure Notifications.

.. Click *Next: Configure Tags*.

. Configure Tags.

.. Under *Key*, enter *Name*.

.. Under *Value*, enter *tw-worker-node*.

.. Click *Review*.

. Click *Create Auto Scaling Group*.
+
After the auto scaling group spins up (it will take some time), validate that your cluster has two more container instances.
Go to *Services > Containers > Elastic Container Service*.
The count for *Container instances* in your cluster should now be a total of three.


[.task]
=== Create a Prisma Cloud Defender task definition

Prisma Cloud provides a task definition template for Defender.
Download the template, then update the variables specific to your environment.
Finally, load the task definition in ECS.

[.procedure]
. Download the https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/attachments/amazon-ecs-task-tw-defender-saas.json[Prisma Cloud Defender task definition], and open it for editing.

. Update the value for `image` to point to Prisma Cloud's cloud registry.
+
Replace the following placeholder strings with the appropriate values:
+
* `<ACCESS-TOKEN>` --
Your Prisma Cloud access token.
All characters must be lowercase.
To convert your access token to lowercase, run:
+
  $ echo <ACCESS-TOKEN> | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'

* `<VERSION>` --
Version of the Console image to retrieve and install.
For example, `19_11_506`.

+
* `<cloud-console>` --
The DNS name for Console.  Retrieved from the Manage > System > Downloads.  The final wss value would look similar to `wss://us-west1.cloud.twistlock.com:443`

+
* `<INSTALL-BUNDLE>` --
Output from the _installBundle_ endpoint.

. Go to *Services > Containers > Elastic Container Service*.

. In the left menu, click *Task Definitions*.
