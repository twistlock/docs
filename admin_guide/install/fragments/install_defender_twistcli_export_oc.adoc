== Install Defender

Defender is installed as a DaemonSet, which ensures that an instance of Defender runs on every node in the cluster.
Use _twistcli_ to generate a YAML configuration file for the Defender DaemonSet, then deploy it using _kubectl_.
You can use the same method to deploy Defender DaemonSets from both macOS and Linux kubectl-enabled cluster controllers.

The benefit of declarative object management, where you work directly with YAML configuration files, is that you get the full "source code" for the objects you create in your cluster.
You can use a version control tool to manage and track modifications to config files so that you can delete and reliably recreate DaemonSets in your environment.

If you don't have kubectl access to your cluster (or oc access for OpenShift), you can deploy Defender DaemonSets directly from the xref:../install/install_defender/install_cluster_container_defender.adoc[Console UI]. 

NOTE: The following procedure shows you how to deploy Defender DaemonSets with twistcli using declarative object management.
Alternatively, you can generate Defender DaemonSet install commands in the Console UI under  *Manage > Defenders > Deploy > DaemonSet*.
Install scripts work on Linux hosts only.
For macOS and Windows hosts, use twistcli to generate Defender DaemonSet YAML configuration files, and then deploy it with oc, as described in the following procedure.

NOTE: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4 now defaults to CRI-O as underlying container engine.
Use the _--cri_ flag for any _twistcli defender export openshift_ command you run.

[.procedure]
. Retrive Console's API address (PRISMA_CLOUD_COMPUTE_CONSOLE_API_ADDR).

.. Sign into Prisma Cloud.

.. Go to *Compute > Manage > System > Downloads*.

.. Copy the URL under *Path to Console*.

. Retrieve Console's service address (PRISMA_CLOUD_COMPUTE_SVC_ADDR).
+
The service address can be derived from the API address by removing the protocol scheme and path.
It is simply the host part of the URL.

.. Go to *Compute > Manage > Defenders > Deploy > DaemonSet*

.. Copy the address from *1* (*The name that clients and Defenders use to access this Console*).

. Generate a _defender.yaml_ file, where:
+
The following command connects to Console's API (specified in _--address_) as user <ADMIN> (specified in _--user_), and generates a Defender DaemonSet YAML config file according to the configuration options passed to _twistcli_.
The _--cluster-address_ option specifies the address Defender uses to connect to Console, or Console's service address.
+
   $ <PLATFORM>/twistcli defender export openshift \
     --address <PRISMA_CLOUD_COMPUTE_CONSOLE_API_ADDR>
     --user <ADMIN_USER> \
     --cluster-address <PRISMA_CLOUD_COMPUTE_SVC_ADDR>
+
* <PLATFORM> can be linux, osx, or windows.
* <ADMIN_USER> is the name of a Prisma Cloud user with the System Admin role.

. Deploy the Defender DaemonSet.

  $ oc create -f ./defender.yaml

. Confirm the Defenders were deployed.

.. In Prisma Cloud Console, go to *Compute > Manage > Defenders > Manage* to see a list of deployed Defenders.

.. In the OpenShift Web Console, go to the Prisma Cloud project's monitoring window to see which pods are running.
+
image::install_openshift_ose_defenders.png[width=800]

.. Use the OpenShift CLI to see the DaemonSet pod count.

  $ oc get ds -n twistlock

  NAME                    DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
  twistlock-defender-ds   4         3         3         3            3           <none>          29m
+
NOTE: The _desired_ and _current_ pod counts do not match.
This is a job for the nodeSelector.
