== Syslog and stdout integration

You can configure Prisma Cloud to send audit event records (audits) to syslog and/or stdout.

Syslog integration must be turned on manually.
Open Console, go to *Alerts > Logging*, then set *Syslog* to *Enabled*.
Prisma Cloud connects to the syslog socket on _/dev/log_.
Stdout integration can be enabled from the same tab.

When you enable syslog or stdout integration, you can optionally enable verbose output.
Verbose output records vulnerability and compliance issues in your environment.
It also records all process activity.

In general, enabling verbose output is not recommended because of the substantial overhead.
You can retrieve this data much more efficiently from the Prisma Cloud API.
Nevertheless, sometimes this capability is expressly required for integration with SIEM tools.

// TODO: Describe all log files in a Prisma Cloud setup.
// By default, logs are sent to Console.
// In addition, each host protected by Defender sends logs to _/var/lib/twistlock/log/defender.log_ on its local file system.

NOTE: Do not enable both syslog and stdout on hosts with systemd.
With systemd, anything sent to stdout gets logged to syslog.
With both syslog and stdout enabled, you would get duplicate messages in syslog.

=== Sending syslog messages to a network endpoint

Writing to _/dev/log_ sends logs to the local host's syslog daemon.
The syslog daemon can then be optionally configured to forward those logs to a remote syslog or SIEM server.
If you don't have access to the underlying host, you can configure Prisma Cloud Console to send log messages directly to your remote system.

NOTE: In most cases, you wonâ€™t need to specify a network endpoint in order to send syslog messages to your SIEM tool.
If you already have log collectors on your hosts, simply enable syslog.
Your log collectors will stream Prisma Cloud syslog messages to your SIEM tool.

Some things to keep in mind:

* Console sends logs directly to your remote server.
When configuring Console with the remote server, validate that the address you enter is actually reachable from the host where Console runs.
Otherwise, you risk losing log messages.

* Because Console sends messages directly to your remote server, and not through the local syslog daemon, you don't get some of syslog's built-in benefits, such as buffering, which protects against network outages and service failures.

* The classic syslog implementation sends logs over UDP.
This is considered a bad practice if your logs have any value.
UDP is connectionless.
Packets are sent to their destination without confirming that they were received.
TCP's stateful connections and retransmission capabilities make it more appropriate for shuttling logs to a SIEM.

[.procedure]
. Log into Console.

. Go to *System > Logging*.

. Set *Syslog* to *Enabled*.

. In *Send syslog messages over the network to*, click *Edit*, and then specify a destination.


[.task]
=== Appending custom strings to syslog messages

ifdef::compute_edition[]
You can configure Prisma Cloud Compute to append a custom string to all Console and Defender syslog messages.
endif::compute_edition[]

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
You can configure Prisma Cloud Compute to append a custom string to all Defender syslog messages.
endif::prisma_cloud[]

Custom strings are set in the event message as a key-value pair, where the key is "id", and the value is your custom string.
The following screenshot shows a Defender event, where the custom string is "koko".

image::defender_syslog_event_with_custom_string.png[width=800]

Configuring a custom string is useful when you have multiple Prisma Cloud Compute deployments (i.e. multiple Compute Consoles) and you're aggregating all messages in a single log management system.
The custom string serves as a marker that lets you correlate specific events to specific deployments.

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Go to *Alerts > Logging > Syslog*.

. Set *Syslog* to *Enabled*.

. For *Identifier*, click *Edit*, and enter a string.


=== Events

Both Console and Defender emit messages.
The data emitted to syslog and stdout is exactly the same.


==== Console events

Console syslog messages are tagged as _Twistlock-Console_ in the logs.


[.section]
===== Image scan

Records when Prisma Cloud scans an image.

Example image scan message:

  Jul 30 18:51:32 aqsa-root Twistlock-Console[1]: 
    time="2019-07-30T18:51:32.214136319Z" 
    type="scan_summary" 
    log_type="image" 
    image_id="sha256:cd14cecfdb3a657ba7d05bea026e7ac8b9abafc6e5c66253ab327c7211fa6281" 
    image_name="aqsa/internal:tag5" 
    vulnerabilities="297" 
    compliance="1"


[.section]
===== Container scan

Records when Prisma Cloud scans a container.

Example container scan message:

  Jul 30 22:06:15 aqsa-root Twistlock-Console[1]: 
    time="2019-07-30T22:06:15.804842461Z"

    container_name="twistlock_console" 
    image_name="twistlock/private:console_19_07_353" 
    compliance="6"


[.section]
===== Host scan

Records when Prisma Cloud scans a host.
Defenders scan the hosts they run on.

Example host scan:

  Jul 30 22:09:53 aqsa-root Twistlock-Console[1]: 
    time="2019-07-30T22:09:53.390680962Z" 
     type="scan_summary" 
     log_type="host" 
     hostname="aqsa-root.c.cto-sandbox.internal" 
     vulnerabilities="89" 
     compliance="17"


[.section]
===== Individual compliance issues

Records a compliance finding.
These messages are tagged with __log_type="compliance"__, and are generated as a byproduct of container scans, image scans, host scans, and registry scans.

Compliance issues are only recorded when *Detailed output for vulnerabilities and compliance* is enabled in *Alerts > Syslog*.

A syslog entry is generated for each compliance issue.
This can result in a significant amount of data, which is why verbose output is disabled by default.

You must have a rule that alerts on compliance issues for an entry to be written to syslog.
It might just be the __Default - alert all components__ rule, or another custom rule.
This option does not simply log all compliance issues irrespective of the rules that are in place.

Example image compliance issue:

  Jul 30 22:18:53 aqsa-root Twistlock-Console[1]: 
    time="2019-07-30T22:18:53.23838464Z"

[.section]
===== Individual vulnerability issues

Records a vulnerability finding.
These messages are tagged with __log_type="vulnerability"__, and are generated as a byproduct of image scans, host scans, and registry scans.

Vulnerability issues are only recorded when *Detailed output for vulnerabilities and compliance* is enabled in *Alerts > Syslog*.

A syslog entry is generated for each vulnerability for each package.
This can result in a significant amount of data, which is why verbose output is disabled by default.

For example, consider a rule that raises an alert when vulnerabilities of medium severity or higher are found in an image.
If there are eleven packages that violate this rule, there will be eleven syslog entries, one for each package.

You must have a rule that alerts on vulnerabilities for an entry to be written to syslog.
It might just be the __Default - alert all components__ rule, or another custom rule.
This option does not simply log all vulnerability data irrespective of the rules that are in place.

Example image vulnerability issue:

  Jul 30 22:19:11 aqsa-root Twistlock-Console[1]: 
    time="2019-07-30T22:19:11.264627256Z"

[.section]
===== Admin activity

Changes to any settings (including previous and new values), changes to any rules (create, modify, or delete), and all logon activity (success and failure) are logged.
For every event, both the user name and source IP are captured.

Example admin acitivty audit:

  
  Jul 30 21:58:16 aqsa-root Twistlock-Console[1]: 
    time="2019-07-30T21:58:16.80522678Z"

    username="aqsa" 
    source_ip="137.83.195.96" 
    api="/api/v1/authenticate" 
    status="successful login attempt"


==== Defender events

Defender syslog messages are tagged as _Twistlock-Defender_ in logs.


[.section]
===== Container runtime audit

Activity that breaches your runtime rules or the automatically generated allow lists in your models generates audits.
The _log_type_ field specifies the runtime sensor that detected the anomaly (filesystem, processes. syscalls, or network).

Example container runtime audit: The following process audit shows that busybox was unexpectedly launched, and an alert was raised.

  Jul 30 22:41:25 aqsa-root Twistlock-Defender[13460]: 
    time="2019-07-30T22:41:25.448709847Z" 
    type="container_runtime_audit" 
    container_id="73c2e8267f9b80ea152403c36c377476d24e43e211bb098300a317b3d1c472e4"

    image_name="ubuntu:18.04" 
    effect="alert" 
    msg="High rate of reg file access events, reporting aggregation started; 
    last event: /usr/lib/apt/methods/gpgv wrote a suspicious file to /tmp/apt.conf.2ZH7tP. 
    Command: /usr/lib/apt/methods/gpgv" 
    log_type="filesystem"


[.section]
===== Host runtime audit

Activity that breaches your runtime rules or the automatically generated allow lists in your host services models generates audits.

Example host runtime audit:

  Jul 30 22:47:12 aqsa-root Twistlock-Defender[13460]: 
    time="2019-07-30T22:47:12.325487039Z" 
    type="host_runtime_audit" 
    service_name="ssh" 
    effect="alert" 
    msg="Outbound connection by /usr/lib/apt/methods/http to an unexpected port: 80 IP: 91.189.91.26. Low severity audit, event is automatically added to the runtime model" 
    log_type="network"
  

[.section]
===== Access audit

Docker commands run on hosts protected by Defender.

With user access events, you can determine who performed an action, and on which resource.

For example:

* [Bruce] [started container X] in the [DEV environment] (allowed).
* [Bruce] [stopped container Y] in the [PROD environment] (denied).

All Docker commands issued to the Docker daemon are intercepted and inspected by Defender to determine if they comply with the policy set in Console.

The following diagram illustrates how Defender operates on the management plane:

. Bruce, a developer, issues a command, docker -H.

. Defender checks the command against the policies defined in the Console.
If the command is allowed, Defender forwards it to the Docker daemon for execution.
If the command is denied, the user is notified.

. An event is recorded in syslog.

image::syslog_integration_554971.png[width=500]

Access audits have the following fields:

* type=access_audit
* user=[String] Identity of the person who ran the command
* action=[String] Docker command requested - API invoked
* action_type=[String] Action type
* allow=[Boolean] true/false - Action was allowed or not.

    block="false"

[.section]
===== Process activity audit

Records all processes spawned in a container.

Process audits are only recorded when *Detailed output of all runtime process activity* is enabled in Alerts > Syslog.

Note that process activity that breaches your runtime policy is separately audited.
For more infomration, see the container runtime audit section.

This audit has the following fields:

* type=process
* pid=Process ID
* path=Path to the executable in the container file system
* md5=MD5 checksum for the executable file
* interactive=Whether the process was spawned from a shell session: true or false
* container-id=Container ID

Example: This audit shows that busybox was spawned in the container with ID 8c5b3fe0037d.

  Jul 30 22:06:03 aqsa-root Twistlock-Defender[13460]: 
    time="2019-07-30T22:06:03.515319204Z"

[.section]
===== Incidents

Incidents are logical groupings of events, related by context, that reveal known attack patterns.

Example container incident:

  Jul 30 22:41:24 aqsa-root Twistlock-Defender[13460]: 
    time="2019-07-30T22:41:24.987209676Z"

    incident_category="serviceViolation"
    audit_ids="5a9c72a223d020590de74db5"


=== Rate limiters

Depending on your configuration, Prisma Cloud can produce a lot of logs, especially in environments with many hosts, images, and containers.
By default, most syslog daemons throttle logging with a rate limiter.

If you have a large environment (hundreds of Defenders with tens of images per host) AND you have configured Prisma Cloud for verbose syslog output, you will need to tune the rate limiter.
Otherwise, you might find that logs are missing.

For example, on RHEL 7, you must tune both systemd-journald's `RateLimitInterval` and `RateLimitBurst` settings and rsyslog's `imjournalRatelimitInterval` and `imjournalRatelimitBurst` settings.
For more information about RedHat settings, see
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1417483[How to disable log rate-limiting in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7].


=== Truncated log messages

Very long syslog events can get truncated.
For example, changing settings in Console generates management_audits events, which show a diff between old settings and new settings.
For policies changes, the diff can be big.
Linux log managers limit the number of characters logged per line, and so long messages, such as management audits, can be truncated.

If you've got truncated log messages, increase the log manager's default string size limit.
There are several types log managers, but rsyslog is popular with most distributions.
For rsyslog, the default log string size is 1024 characters per line.
To increase it, open _/etc/rsyslog.conf_ and set the maximum message size:

  $MaxMessageSize 20k
