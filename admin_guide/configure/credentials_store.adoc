== Credentials store

Container environments tend to utilize many third party services across multiple cloud providers.
To improve accessibility and reusability, Prisma Cloud manages all credentials in a central encrypted store.
Credentials are used when setting up the following integrations:

* Scanning (container registries, serverless functions, etc).
* Alerting in third party services (email, Slack, ServiceNow, etc).
* Deploying and managing Defender DaemonSets from the Console UI.
* Injecting secrets from secret stores into containers at runtime.

image::credentials_store_arch.png[width=700]

The credential store can be found under *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store*.
Credentials cannot be deleted if they are currently in use.
To see all the places where a credentials is being used, click on an entry in the credentials store table, and review the *Usages* list.

If a credential is being used by an integration, and you edit its parameters (e.g. username, password, etc), the new values are automatically propagated to the right places in the product.
You don't need to delete and set up the integration again to refresh the credential's values.

=== Prisma Cloud Onboarded accounts

When you start with a fresh Prisma Cloud tenant, you can use the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/cloud-account-onboarding.html[guided onboarding flow] to automatically create service accounts and roles in your cloud provider accounts so that Prisma Cloud can be quickly integrated with your cloud providers.

The guided onboarding flow creates service accounts and roles for the following Compute-specific integrations.
For all other integrations, manually create the required service accounts or roles according to the https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/downloads/Compute-Feature-Wise-Permissions.pdf[feature-wise permissions doc].

==== Prisma Cloud AWS accounts

Compute feature specific minimalistic permissions are added by default to all CloudFormation Templates for AWS accounts onboarded to Prisma Cloud.   
These permissions are defined by the following two roles.

NOTE: You can remove these roles from the CFTs if you do not wish to use onboarded cloud accounts for Compute capabilities. 

**PrismaCloud-ReadOnly-Policy-Compute**

* ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability
* ecr:BatchGetImage
* ecr:DescribeImageScanFindings
* ecr:GetAuthorizationToken
* ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer
* ecr:GetLifecyclePolicyPreview
* ecr:ListImages
* kms:Decrypt
* lambda:GetFunction

**PrismaCloud-Remediation-Policy-Compute**

* ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress
* ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress
* ec2:CreateSecurityGroup
* ec2:CreateTags
* lambda:GetLayerVersion
* lambda:PublishLayerVersion
* lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration
* ssm:CreateAssociation

NOTE: Some additional permissions required for Compute features like AMI scanning are missing from these templates in order to keep minimalist privileges.
You can find full list of feature wise AWS permissions here: http://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/downloads/Compute-Feature-Wise-Permissions.pdf and add them manually.


===== Cloud Account Permission Status

Currently cloud account status checks do not take Compute permissions into account. 
They will remain green even if Compute permissions are missing in order to accomodate for the CSPM users who do not use Compute functionalities and thus change in account status could cause confusions.


==== Prisma Cloud Azure accounts

No additional permissions are added for Compute to the onboarding templates. 
You can add the following permissions for Serverless and Cloud Discovery scans.

   "Microsoft.Web/sites/publishxml/action",
    "Microsoft.Web/sites/Read",
    "Microsoft.Web/sites/config/Read",
    "Microsoft.Web/sites/functions/read",
    "Microsoft.Web/sites/config/list/action",
    "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/read",
    "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/metadata/read",
    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read",
    "Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/read"


==== Prisma Cloud GCP accounts

No additional permissions are added for Compute to the onboarding templates.
You can find full list of GCP permissions below and add them manually.

**For projects:**

      "storage.objects.get",
      "storage.objects.list",
      "pubsub.topics.publish",
      "iam.serviceAccounts.get",
      "iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken",
      "iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken",
      "iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation",
      "iam.serviceAccounts.list",
      "iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob",
      "iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt"

**For ORG:**

      "resourcemanager.projects.get",
      "resourcemanager.projects.list"

=== Using onboarded accounts

The service accounts and roles required for integrating Prisma Cloud with your cloud provider can be automatically created in your cloud account for you.
Initiate the onboarding process from *Settings > Cloud Accounts*.

image::credentials_store_prisma_cloud_oboarding.png[width=800]

After onboarding an account, you can use the service accounts and roles, collectively called credentials, when configuring Compute.
Before using a credential, however, you must first "surface" the credential in Compute.

Surfaced credentials are read-only in the Compute tab.
Update them at the source in *Settings > Cloud Accounts*.

Similarly, deleting surfaced credentials in the Compute tab's credentials store only removes them from the table.
Delete them at the source in *Settings > Cloud Accounts*.

[.procedure]
. After logging into Prisma Cloud, go to to the *Compute > Defend > Authentication* tab.

. Click *Add Credential*.

. In *Type*, select *Prisma Cloud*.

. Select all credentials you want to use.
+
image::credentials_store_surface_prisma_cloud_cred.png[width=500]

. Click *Save*.

. You can now use the credential in Compute.
+
For example, to set up registry scanning for AWS ECR:

.. Go to *Compute > Defend > Vulnerabilities*.

.. Go to *Images > Registry Settings*, and click *Add Registry*.

.. When you're setting up the integration, select the surfaced credential is available for use.

[#_aws]
=== AWS

Prisma Cloud lets you authenticate with AWS three different ways:

* IAM users
* IAM roles
* Security Token Service (STS) (Recommended)


[.section, #_aws_iam_users]
==== IAM users

IAM users are entities that represent persons or applications.
The Prisma Cloud credentials store lets you save credentials for IAM users.
When creating a new credential, select the AWS type, and enter an access key ID and secret access key.

image::credentials_store_iam_user.png[width=500]


[.section]
==== IAM roles

IAM roles are identities, associated with permissions policies, that can be assumed by the resources that need them.
Setting up Prisma Cloud to authenticate with IAM roles is handled in the subsystem-specific configuration dialogs.

For example, when you configure Prisma Cloud to scan an ECR repository, go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Registry*, and click *Add registry*.
In the *Version* drop-down list, select *Amazon EC2 Container Registry*, and set *Use IAM role* to *On*.
No other credentials need to be provided.

image::credentials_store_iam_role.png[width=500]


[.section]
==== How Prisma Cloud accesses IAM role credentials

Roles provide a way to grant credentials to applications that run on EC2 instances to access other AWS services, such as ECR.
IAM dynamically provides temporary credentials to the EC2 instances, and these credentials are automatically rotated for you.

When you create an EC2 instance, you can assign it a role.
When the instance is started, the AWS instance metadata service (IMDS) attaches your credentials to the running EC2 instance.
You can access this metadata from within the instance using the following command:

[source]
----
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<POLICY_NAME>
{
"Code" : "Success",
"LastUpdated" : "2017-06-29T06:12:29Z",
"Type" : "AWS-HMAC",
"AccessKeyId" : "ASIA...",
"SecretAccessKey" : "3VI...",
"Token" : "dzE...",
"Expiration" : "2017-06-29T12:16:54Z"
}
----

Where `<POLICY_NAME>` is assigned to the EC2 instance when it is created or at some point during its life.

The following diagram shows all the pieces.
Defender retrieves the credentials from the metadata service, then uses those credentials to retrieve and scan the container images in ECR.

image::credentials_store_scan_ecr_iam_role.png[width=500]


[.section, #_aws_security_token_service_sts]
==== AWS Security Token Service (STS) (Recommended)

AWS Security Token Service (STS) lets you request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS IAM users or users that you authenticate (federated users).
Like IAM roles, setting up Prisma Cloud to use STS is handled in the subsystem-specific configuration dialogs, such as registry scanning and serverless function scanning.

This method is recommended as a best practice per the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

When you configure integration with an AWS resource, you can pick an AWS credential from the central store, then use STS to change the role of the account.
AWS STS lets you have a few number of IAM identities that can be used across many AWS accounts.
For example, if you were setting up Prisma Cloud to scan an AWS ECR registry, you would select the AWS credentials from the central store.
Then you would enable *Use AWS STS*, and enter the name of the STS role to assume in the target account.

When using AWS STS, ensure the following:

* The policy of the IAM user you use as credentials has *sts:AssumeRole* permission on the IAM role you're going to assume. Sample policy:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/stsIAMrole"
        }
    ]
}
----

* The IAM role you're going to assume has the IAM user mentioned above configured as a trusted entity.
Sample trusted entity policy:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789123:user/prismaUser"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
----


=== Azure

This section discusses Azure credentials.


[.task, #_azure_service_principal]
==== Creating an Azure Service Principal

Create an Azure Service Principal so that Prisma Cloud Console can scan your Azure tenant for microservices.
To get a service key:

[.procedure]
. Download and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[install the Azure CLI].

. Create a service principal and configure its access to Azure resources.

  $ az ad sp create-for-rbac \
    --name <user>.twistlock-azure-cloud-discovery-<contributor|reader> \
    --role <reader|contributor> \
    --sdk-auth
+
The *--role* value depends upon the type of scanning:
+
* contributor = Cloud Discovery + Azure Container Registry Scanning + Azure Function Apps Scanning
* reader = Cloud Discovery + Azure Container Registry Scanning

. Copy the output of the command and set it aside.
It will be used as the *Service Key* when creating an Azure credential.
+

[.task]
==== Storing the credential in Prisma Cloud

Store the service principal's credentials in Console so that Prisma Cloud can authenticate with Azure for scanning.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store*.

. Click *Add credential*, and enter the following values:

.. In the *Name* field, enter a label to identify the credential.

.. In the *Type* field, select *Azure*.

.. In the *Service Key* field, enter the value returned by the Azure CLI tool when you created the service principal.

.. Click *Save*.


=== Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Accessing GCP to scan resources can be done in one of two ways.  You can make use of a service account and create a key for that account or you can use an API Key.  Google recommends that you use a service account with a key and we document that here.  More information is available here https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys


[.task]
==== Creating a service account

Create a service account that Prisma Cloud can use to scan your resources in GCP.

[.procedure]
. Google provide a comprehensive guide for creating a service account - https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts

. Create a key for this service account.  The format of this key should be JSON.  Google have a guide for this - https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys

. Copy the contents of the downloaded key, here is an example:

+

==== Storing the credential in Prisma Cloud

Store your GCP credential in Prisma Cloud.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store*.

. Click *Add credential*, and enter the following values:

.. In the *Name* field, enter a label to identify the credential.

.. In the *Type* field, select *GCP*.

.. Leave the *API token* blank

.. Click *Save*.


[#_ibm_cedential]
=== IBM Cloud

Prisma Cloud integrates with IBM Cloud Security Advisor.
To enable the integration, you must provide credentials, which consist of an https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/cloud-monitoring/qa/cli_qa.html#account_guid[Account GUID] and https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYJJF_1.0.0/ApplicationSecurityonCloud/appseccloud_generate_api_key_cm.html[API Key].

image::IBM_Credential.png[width=500]


[.task, #_kubeconfig]
=== Kubeconfig

Kubernetes stores cluster authentication information in a YAML file known as kubeconfig.
The kubeconfig file grants access to clients, such as kubectl, to run commands against the cluster.
By default, kubeconfig is stored in _$HOME/.kube/config_.

Prisma Cloud uses the kubeconfig credential to deploy and upgrade Defender DaemonSets directly from the xref:../install/install_defender/install_cluster_container_defender.adoc#[Console UI].
If you plan to manage DaemonSets from the command line with kubectl, you don't need to create this credential type.

The user or service account in your kubeconfig must have permissions to create and delete the following resources:

* ClusterRole
* ClusterRoleBinding
* DaemonSet
* Secret
* ServiceAccount

// https://github.com/twistlock/twistlock/issues/14707
NOTE: Prisma Cloud doesn't currently support kubeconfig credentials for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service(EKS) clusters.
The kubeconfig for these requires an external binary (specifically the Google Cloud SDK and aws-iam-authenticator, respectively) for authentication, and the Prisma Cloud Console doesn't ship with this binary.


[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store*.

. Click *Add credential*, and enter the following values:

.. In *Name*, enter a label to identify the credential.

.. In *Type* , select *Kubeconfig*.

.. In *Kubeconfig*, paste the contents of your _kubeconfig_ file.
