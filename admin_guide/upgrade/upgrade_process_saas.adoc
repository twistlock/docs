== Upgrade process

Palo Alto Networks manages and maintains your Prisma Cloud Console.
For email notifications about Prisma Cloud Compute's maintenance schedules and upgrade notifications, subscribe to the Prisma Cloud service on the https://status.paloaltonetworks.com/[Palo Alto Networks status page].


=== Console 

Palo Alto Networks periodically upgrades your Prisma Cloud Compute Console.
Detailed upgrade plans for each release are always published on our https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/enterprise_edition/welcome/announcements.html[announcements page].
Ensure that you have read through all 'Breaking Changes' in release notes for each major release, for any action items from the users.

The currently installed version of Console is displayed in the bell menu.

=== Prisma Cloud Compute components

The versions of all deployed components should match exactly.
To support the SaaS upgrade process, older versions of Prisma Cloud Compute components can continue to interoperate with newer versions of Console in a limited way.
Plan to upgrade all Prisma Cloud Compute components as soon as possible.


=== Defenders

Console will automatically upgrade most Defender types for you. 
If Console fails to upgrade one or more Defenders, you will see error messages under **Manage > Defenders > Manage** tab. 
If you've created an alert for Defender health events, Console emits a message on the alert channel for any Defender it fails to upgrade.
Contact our support team if you need assistance.

=== Other components

Manually upgrade all other Prisma Cloud Compute components, such as the Jenkins plugin and twistcli, so that their versions exactly match Console's version.

NOTE: If problems due to version mismatches are encountered during the upgrade window, twistcli and the Jenkins plugin are designed to fail open so that CI/CD pipelines do not break when Console is upgraded.

API changes are documented with each release.
See the xref:../api/stable_api.adoc[stability guide] to learn more about the most commonly used API endpoints.
