== Access the API

The API reference can be found https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/api/twistlock_api.html[here].

To access the Compute API, you must first get your Compute Console's address.
Retrieve your Compute Console's address directly from the UI.
Go to *Compute > Manage > System > Downloads* and copy the *Path to Console*.
All example commands specify a variable called COMPUTE_CONSOLE, which represents the address for your Console.

You can access the Compute API with your Prisma Cloud user credentials.
Note that only Prisma Cloud users with the System Admin role can access Compute.
By default, the Prisma Cloud System Admin role is mapped to the xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[Prisma Cloud Compute Administrator role].

For automated workflows, you'll want to xref:../authentication/access_keys.adoc[provision a service account] with the minimum required permissions.


[.task]
=== Accessing the API using Basic authentication

Get your Compute Console's address and then use basic auth to access the API.

[.procedure]
. Get the path to your Console.

.. Go to *Compute > Manage > System > Downloads*.

.. Under *Path to Console*, click *Copy*.

. Access an API endpoint.
+
In this example, retrieve the rules in your compliance policy.
The Auditor role has permission to see this data.

  $ curl \
    -u <PRISMA_CLOUD_USER> \
    https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>/api/v1/policies/compliance/container


[.task]
=== Accessing the API using token authentication

Get your Compute Console's address, retrieve an token, then use the token to access the API.

[.procedure]
. Get the path to your Console.

.. Go to *Compute > Manage > System > Downloads*.

.. Under *Path to Console*, click *Copy*.

. Retrieve a token from the api/v1/authenticate endpoint with your user credentials.
Tokens are valid for 24 hours.

  $ curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"<PRISMA_CLOUD_USER>", "password":"<PASSWD>"}' \
    https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>/api/v1/authenticate
  {
   "token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
  }
+
If you integrated Prisma Cloud with Active Directory, and you're using the sAMAccountName _user identifier_, escape the backslash in DOMAIN\sAMAccountName.
For example:

  $ curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"DOMAIN\\<USERNAME>", "password":"<PASSWORD>"}' \
    <COMPUTE_CONSOLE>/api/v1/authenticate
  {
   "token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
  }

. Call the Prisma Cloud API, submitting the token in the Authorization field of the HTTP header of your request.
+
For example, test the connection by retrieving your compliance policies.

  $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..." \
    <COMPUTE_CONSOLE>/api/v1/policies/compliance/container

== Access the API

The API reference can be found https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/api/twistlock_api.html[here].

The Prisma Cloud API is exposed on the host that runs Console on port 8083 (HTTPS).
The port is specified at install time in _twistlock.cfg_.

All example commands specify a variable called COMPUTE_CONSOLE, which represents the address for your Console.
The address for your Console depends on how you installed it.

For Onebox installs, where you install Console on a stand-alone host, the value for COMPUTE_CONSOLE is the IP address or DNS name of the host.
HTTPS access to Console is servered on port 8083, so the full address would be:

COMPUTE_CONSOLE = \https://<IPADDR>:8083

For the default Kubernetes installation procedure, the Console service is exposed by a LoadBalancer, and so the address for COMPUTE_CONSOLE is

COMPUTE_CONSLE = \https://<LOAD_BALANCER>:8083

Access to the API requires authentication.
You can either:

* Retrieve a token, then pass the token in the Authorization field of all subsequent requests.
* Use Basic HTTP authentication for each request.

[NOTE]
====
The default install of Prisma Cloud Compute Edition uses self-signed certificates.
By default, curl validates the server's certificate.
Because the certificate for the CA that signed the server's cert isn't in your CA store, curl can't validate the server's cert.

You've got two options:

* Pass the --insecure flag to curl.
With this flag, validation that the server is who it claims to be is bypassed.
The connection is still encrypted.

* Configure Prisma Cloud Compute to use your own custom certs.

[.task]
=== Accessing the API using Basic authentication

The basic token is a Base64 encoded string of type username:password.

[.procedure]
. Generate the Base64 encoding of your username and password.
Assume your username is api, and your password is api.

  $ echo -n "api:api" | openssl base64
  YXBpOmFwaQ==

. To access any other endpoint, set the Authorization field of your HTTP header to Basic and add the encoded string.
For example, to get all your runtime container policies:

  $ curl --insecure \
    -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' \
    https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/policies/runtime/container
+
NOTE: The curl command can handle basic auth for you with the --user option.


[.task]
=== Accessing the API using token authentication

To access the API using a token:

[.procedure]
. Retrieve a token from the api/v1/authenticate endpoint with your user credentials.
Tokens are valid for 24 hours.
You can also retrieve tokens <<_retrieve_token_client_cert,using client certificates>>.

  $ curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"admin", "password":"admin"}' \
    https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/authenticate
  {
   "token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
  }
+
If you integrated Prisma Cloud Console with Active Directory, and you're using the sAMAccountName _user identifier_, escape the backslash in the DOMAIN\sAMAccountName username value.
For example:

  $ curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"DOMAIN\\admin", "password":"admin"}' \
    https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/authenticate
  {
   "token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
  }

. Call the Prisma Cloud API, submitting the token in the Authorization field in the HTTP header of your request.
For example, test connection to the API using the _/api/v1/policies_ endpoint:

  $ curl --insecure \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..." \
    https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/policies/runtime/container


[.task, #_retrieve_token_client_cert]
=== Accessing the API using a client certificate

You can retrieve a token using client certificates issued by your public key infrastructure.

*Prerequisites:*

* You have configured Prisma Cloud Console with your server certificate.
Go to *Manage > Authentication > Certificates > TLS certificate for Console*, and upload your certificate (cat the cert and private key into a single file).

[.procedure]
. Install your client certificate on your local machine.

. Request a token using your client certificate.

  $ curl --insecure \
    -X POST \
    --cert cert.pem \
    https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/authenticate-client
  {
   "token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
  }

. Call the Prisma Cloud API, submitting the token in the Authorization field in the HTTP header of your request.
For example, to get all policies:

  $ curl --insecure \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..." \
    https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/policies/runtime/container
