== 20.09 Porting Guide

This article outlines the differences in the API between 20.04 and 20.09.
It's intended to help you port your code forward to the latest version of Prisma Cloud Compute.


=== Breaking changes

If you're using any of the following endpoints, you'll need to update your integrations when migrating to 20.09.


==== Defender install with /api/v1/scripts

The method for accessing the following endpoints has changed from `GET` to `POST`:

* `/api/v1/scripts/defender.sh`
* `/api/v1/scripts/defender.ps1`


==== Defender install with /api/v1/defenders

The method for accessing the following endpoints has changed from `GET` to `POST`:

* `/api/v1/defenders/helm/twistlock-defender-helm.tar.gz`
* `/api/v1/defenders/daemonset.yaml`


==== Scan configuration

Starting in 20.09, all endpoints that take credentials now uniformly reference them by credential ID.
Credential details are no longer specified inline with POST requests or returned in GET responses in the `credential` object.
If you're configuring registry or serverless scanning via the API, you'll need to update the way you invoke the following endpoints to reference the credential ID:

* `/api/v1/settings/registry`
* `/api/v1/settings/serverless-scan`

The following snippet shows the response from `GET /api/v1/settings/registry` in 20.09.
Notice that the `credential` object now holds null values.
The `credentialID` is what Primsa Cloud uses to scan the registry.

==== Serverless auto-protect

Serverless auto-protect lets you automatically add the Serverless Defender to the AWS Lambda functions deployed in your account.
The endpoints for managing this capability have changed.

Old 20.04 endpoints:

* `POST /api/v1/settings/serverless-auto-protect`
* `GET /api/v1/settings/serverless-auto-protect`
* `GET /api/v1/statuses/serverless-autoprotect`

New 20.09 endpoints:

* `POST /api/v1/settings/serverless-auto-deploy`
* `GET /api/v1/settings/serverless-auto-deploy`
* `GET /api/v1/statuses/serverless-auto-deploy`


=== Deprecated

The following endpoints have been deprecated in line with the features that have been deprecated in 20.09.


==== CNNF policies and enforcement

Enforcment in CNNF is not supported in 20.09 but will return in the next major release.
If you rely on CNNF enforcement, consider skipping 20.09.
When the next major release ships, steps will be provided to export rules from 20.04 and import them into it.
CNNF rules will be deleted on upgrade.
