== Cloud discovery

It's difficult to ensure that all your apps running on all the different types of cloud services are being properly secured.
If you're using multiple cloud platforms, you might have many separate accounts per platform.
You could easily have hundreds of combinations of providers, accounts, and regions where cloud native services are being deployed.

Cloud Platforms discovery helps you find all cloud-native services being used in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, across all regions, and across all accounts.
Cloud Provider discovery continuously monitors these accounts, detects when new services are added, and reports which services are unprotected.
It can help mitigate your exposure to rogue deployments, abandoned environments, and sprawl.

Cloud Platforms discovery offers coverage for the following services.

*Registries:*

* AWS
* Azure
* Google Cloud

*Serverless functions:*

* AWS
* Azure
* Google Cloud

^1^ *Managed platforms:*

* AWS ECS
* AWS EKS
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Azure Container Instances (ACI)
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

^1^ *Virtual machines:*

* AWS EC2


^1^One-click protection is currently not yet available for these services.
One-click protection lets you deploy Prisma Cloud to protect a resource directly from the scan results page.

//== Minimum permissions
//
//When creating credentials, Prisma Cloud needs some set of minimum permissions to list all the various resources in use in your account.
//After finding those resources, Prisma Cloud needs additional permissions to retrieve those resources and inspect them for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
//
//These are the minimum set of permissions required for each type of account:
//
//AWS
//
//Azure
//
//Google Cloud

=== Configuring cloud platforms discovery

Set up Prisma Cloud to scan your cloud platform accounts for cloud-native resources and services.
Then configure Prisma Cloud to protect them with a single click.

*Prerequisites:* 

* For AWS, you've got a service account with following minimum permissions policy:

* For Azure, you've xref:../configure/credentials_store.adoc#_azure_service_principal[created a service principal with the reader role].

* For GCP, you've xref:../configure/credentials_store.adoc#google-cloud-platform-gcp[created a service account with viewer role].  To be more specific you can also create a service account with Storage Object Viewer, Kubernetes Engine Cluster Viewer, and Cloud Functions Viewer.

. Open Console.

. Go to *Defend > Compliance > Cloud Platforms*.

. Select the accounts to scan with the *Discovery* checkbox.
If there are no accounts in the table, add one in the xref:../configure/credentials_store.adoc#[credentials store].

. Click *Save*.

. Review the scan report.

..  Go to *Monitor > Compliance > Cloud Discovery* to see the scan report in tabular format.

..  Go to *Radar* and select *Cloud* to see the scan report in a visual format.

..  Click *Protect* for the entities you want Prisma Cloud to scan for vulnerabilities.

When you click *Protect*, a new scan rule is proposed.
Select the appropriate credential, tweak the scan rule as desired, then click *Add*.

..  Scan reports can viewed under *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > {Registry|Functions}*.

=== Configuring cloud compliance scans

Prisma Cloud can assess your AWS account against the CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations v1.2.0 benchmark.
This benchmark provides prescriptive guidance for configuring security options for a subset of Amazon Web Services.
It has four sections:

* Identity and Access Management
* Logging
* Monitoring
* Networking

As with all scanning in Prisma Cloud, there are two flows:

* Periodic scanning, which is configurable in *Manage > System > Scan*, and set to a default of once every 24 hours.
* Manual scanning, which lets you force a scan immediately by pressing the *Scan* button in *Monitor > Compliance > Cloud Compliance*.

*Prerequisites:*

* You have a service account with the following minimum permissions policy.
