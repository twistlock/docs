== API Protection

WAAS is able to enforce API security based on specifications provided in the form of https://swagger.io/[Swagger] or https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI] files.
WAAS also allows for manual API definition. E.g. paths, allowed HTTP methods, parameter names, input types, value ranges, etc.
Once defined, users can choose WAAS actions to apply for requests which do not comply with the API's expected behavior.

NOTE: Enforcement for `body`, `header` and `formData` parameters is currently not supported by WAAS.

NOTE: Users should be careful when enabling <<./waas_advanced_settings.adoc#prisma_session,Prisma Session Cookies>> along with API protection. <<./waas_advanced_settings.adoc#prisma_session,Prisma Session Cookies>> mandates client's support of cookies and javascript in order for them to reach the protected application. As APIs are often accessed by "primitive" automation clients, avoid enabling <<./waas_advanced_settings.adoc#prisma_session,Prisma Session Cookies>> unless you are certain all clients accessing the protected API support BOTH cookies AND Javascript.

=== Importing API Definition From Swagger or OpenAPI

. Enter *App Definiton* Tab.
+
image::./waas_app_definition.png[width=650]
. Click on *Import*.
+
image::./waas_import_api.png[width=650]
. Select definition file to load.
. Select *API Protection* Tab.
+
image::./waas_api_protection_tab.png[width=650]
. Review path and parameter definitions listed under *API Resources*.
+
. Select *Endpoint Setup* Tab.
+
image::./waas_endpoint_setup_tab.png[width=650]
. Review protected endpoints listed under *Protected Endpoints* and verify configured base paths all end with a trailing `*`.
+
NOTE: Base path in the endpoint definition should always end with a `{asterisk}` e.g. _"/{asterisk}"_, _"/api/v2/{asterisk}"_.
If not configured that way, API protection will not apply to sub-paths defined in the API protection tab. 

. Enter *App Firewall* Tab.
+
image::./waas_app_firewall_tab.png[width=650]
. Assign *API Protection* <<actions, action>> for resources defined under *API Resources* tab and an <<actions, action>> for all other paths.
+

=== Manual API Definition

. Enter *App Definiton* Tab.
+
image::./waas_app_definition.png[width=650]
. Select *Endpoint Setup* Tab.
+
image::./waas_endpoint_setup_tab.png[width=650]
. Add protected endpoints under *Protected Endpoints* and verify configured base paths all end with a trailing `*`.
+
NOTE: Base path in the endpoint definition should always end with a `{asterisk}` e.g. _"/{asterisk}"_, _"/api/v2/{asterisk}"_.
If not configured that way, API protection will not apply to sub-paths defined in the API protection tab. 
. Select *API Protection* Tab.
+
image::./waas_api_protection_tab_empty.png[width=650]
. Click *Add Path*
. Enter *Resource Path* (e.g. _/product_  - resource paths should not end with a trailing _"/"_)
+
image::./waas_api_protection_path_methods.png[width=650]
+
Paths entered in this section are additional subpaths to the base path defined in the previous endpoint section. for example, if in the endpoint definition hostname was set to _"www.example.com"_, base path set to _"/api/v2/{asterisk}"_ and in the *API Protection* tab resource path set to _"/product"_ - full protected resource would be `www.example.com/api/v2/product`.  
. Select allowed *HTTP Methods*.
+
image::./waas_select_methods.png[width=350]
. For each allowed HTTP method, define parameters by selecting the method from *Parameters for* dropdown list.
+
image::./cnaf_api_protection_select_method.png[width=350]

.. Select HTTP method from dropdown list
.. Click *Add Parameter* 
.. Enter parameter http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#parameter-object[definition]
+
image::./cnaf_api_add_parameter.png[width=550]
. Enter *App Firewall* Tab.
+
image::./waas_app_firewall_tab.png[width=650]
. Assign *API Protection* <<actions, action>> for resources defined under *API Resources* tab and an <<actions, action>> for all other paths.

[#actions]
=== API Actions
HTTP requests that trigger API protections are subject to one of the following actions:

* *Alert* - Request is passed to the protected application and an audit is generated for visibility.
* *Prevent* - Request is denied from reaching the protected application, an audit is generated and WAAS responds with an HTML banner indicating the request was blocked.
* *Ban* - Can be applied on either IP or <<./waas_advanced_settings.adoc#prisma_session,Prisma Session IDs>>. All requests originating from the same IP/Prisma Session to the protected application are denied for the configured time period (default is 5 minutes) following the last detected attack. for more information on enabling Prisma Sessions and configuring ban definitions please refer to the xref:./waas_advanced_settings.adoc[Advanced Settings] help page.

NOTE: To enable ban by Prisma Session ID, <<./waas_advanced_settings.adoc#prisma_session,Prisma Session Cookies>> has to be enabled in the Advanced Settings tab. for more information please refer to the xref:./waas_advanced_settings.adoc#prisma_session[Advanced Settings] help page.

NOTE: WAAS implements state, which is required for banning user sessions by IP address.
Because Defenders do not share state, any application that is replicated across multiple nodes must enable IP address stickiness on the load balancer.
