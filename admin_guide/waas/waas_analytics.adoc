== WAAS Analytics

WAAS analytics provide users a way to investigate events and rule triggers.

* For container WAAS events go to *Monitor > Events > WAAS for containers*
* For host WAAS events go to *Monitor > Events > WAAS for hosts*
* For App-Embedded WAAS events go to *Monitor > Events > WAAS for App-Embedded*
* For serverless WAAS events go to *Monitor > Events > WAAS for Serverless*

NOTE: WAAS retains up to 200,000 events for each type (container, hosts, app-embedded and serverless). Once the limit is reached, oldest events will get over-written by new ones.

NOTE: Similar audits are aggregated and grouped into a single event when received in close succession (less than 5 minutes apart). Audits are aggregated by a combination of IP, HTTP hostname, path, HTTP method, User-Agent and attack type.

=== Analytics workflow

WAAS analytics allows for the review of incidents by analyzing events across various dimensions, inspecting individual requests, and applying filtering to focus on common characteristics or trends.

=== Event graph

image::./waas_timeline.png[width=750]

A timeline graph shows the total number of events. +
Each column on the timeline graph represents a dynamic period - hover over a column to reveal its start, end and event count. 

`Date` filter can be used to adjust the timeline scope.

=== Filters
Filter can be adjusted by using the filtering line:

The filter line uses auto-complete for filter names and filter values. +
Once set, the filters would apply on the graph and aggregation view.

=== Aggregation view

The aggregation view can be altered to group audits based on various data dimensions by clicking on the image:./waas_add_column.png[width=100] button.

Users can add up to 6 dimensions to the aggregation and the Total column will be updated dynamically.

By default, aggregation view is sorted by the "Total" column. Sorting can be changed by clicking a column name.

Click on a line in the aggregation view to inspect the requests group by it. 

=== Request view

Request view details all of the requests group by each line of the aggregated view. +
For each request the following data points are available:

.Audit data
* *Time* - timestamp of the audit.
* *Effect* - effect set by policy.
* *Log Type* - attack type.
* *Container / Host / App / Function Details* - These fields include the id and name of the protected entity. 

.Forensics
* *Forensic Message* - details on what caused the rule to trigger - payload content, location and additional relevant information. 

.HTTP request
* *Method* - HTTP method used in the request.
* *User-Agent* - value of the User-Agent HTTP header. 
* *Host* - hostname specified in the `Host` HTTP header or the host part of the URL.
* *URL* - full request urls (host and path) shown in a URL decoded or encoded form.   
* *Path* - path element from the request URI. 
* *Query* - query string.
* *Header Names* - list of the HTTP header names included in the request (sorted alphabetically).

.Attacker 
* *Source IP* - IP address from which the request originated. If an `X-Forwarded-For` header was included in the HTTP headers, source IP field will detail the first IP listed in the header value (true client IP). 
* *Source Country* - source country associated with the source IP. 
* *Connecting IPs* - entire connectivity chain, including true client IP and any transparent proxies listed in the HTTP request.


Users can user the `Raw` button to view the HTTP request in it's raw form:
