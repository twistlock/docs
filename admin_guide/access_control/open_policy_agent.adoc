== Admission control with Open Policy Agent

Prisma Cloud provides a dynamic https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/[admission controller] for Kubernetes that's built on the https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/[Open Policy Agent (OPA)].
In Console, you can manage and compose rules in Rego, which is OPA's native query language.
Rules can whitelist or blacklist (alert or block) pods.
Console pushes your policies to Defender, which enforces them.
Decisions made by the system are logged.

NOTE: There is currently no support for OpenShift or Windows.


=== Open Policy Agent

The Open Policy Agent is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that lets you consolidate policy enforcement in a single place.
OPA can enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and so on.
OPA provides a high-level declarative language called Rego, which lets you specify policy as code.
The OPA APIs let you offload policy decision-making from your software.

OPA decouples policy decision-making from policy enforcement.
When your software needs to make policy decisions, it queries OPA and supplies structured data, such as JSON, as input.
The data can be inspected and transformed using OPAâ€™s native query language Rego.
OPA generates policy decisions by evaluating the query input and against policies and data.

Prisma Cloud operationalizes OPA by:

* Extending Console to manage and compose policies in Rego.
* Integrating OPA's decision-making library into Defender.
* Connecting Defender's enforcement capabilities to OPA's decisions.


=== Admission webhook

An admission controller is code that intercepts requests to the API server for creating objects.
There are two types of admission controllers: built-in and dynamic.
Prisma Cloud implements a dynamic admission controller.

Dynamic admission controllers are built as webhooks.
After registering to intercept admission requests, they assess requests against policy, and then accept or reject those requests.
In Kubernetes terms, these are known as _validating admission webhooks_.

The Prisma Cloud validating admission webhook handles the API server's AdmissionReview requests, and returns decisions in an AdmissionReview object.
When configuring Prisma Cloud, you'll create a ValidatingWebookConfiguration object, which sets up the Defender service to intercept all create, update, and connect calls to the API server.

The default ValidatingWebookConfiguration provided here sets failurePolicy to Ignore.
The failure policy specifies how your cluster handles unrecognized errors and timeout errors from the admission webhook.
When set to Ignore, the API request is allowed to continue.


[.task]
=== Configuring the webhook

Configure the API server to route AdmissionReview requests to Prisma Cloud.

NOTE: The ValidatingWebhookConfiguration provided in Console is for API version v1beta.
For Kubernetes 1.16 and later, the API version is v1.
The v1 object is different than the v1beta object.
For the v1 template, see the <<_templates,template section>>.

*Prerequisites:*

* You have a running instance of Prisma Cloud Compute Console.
* You have a Kubernetes cluster.
Minimum supported version is v1.13.
* Defender has been deployed to your cluster as a DaemonSet.
In Console, you can verify Defenders are running and connected under *Manage > Defenders > Manage*.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Manage > Defenders*.

. Click on *Advanced Settings*.

.. Enable admission control.

.. Copy the YAML template from <<_templates,here>>.
+
The YAML template provided in the *Advanced Settings* dialog is designed for Kubernetes v1.13-1.15 only.
For Kubernetes v1.16 or later, copy the v1.16 template from <<_templates,here>>.

.. Click *Save*.

. Create a file named `webhook.yaml`, and open it for editing.

. Paste the YAML into your editor, and replace the following fields:
+
* `TW-CA-BUNDLE` - from the daemonset file downloaded in previous section, search for `ca.pem` and copy the content to it's right (after the ":").
* `TW-NAMESPACE` - replace with the namespace chosen in previous section (where the Defender is deployed) - if you did not change anything, this would be `twistlock`

. Create the webhook configuration object.
+
After creating the object, the Kubenetest API server directs AdmissionReview requests to Defender.

  $ kubectl apply -f webhook.yaml


[#_templates]
=== Kubernetes webhook templates

The ValidatingWebhookConfiguration provided in Console is designed for Kubernetes v1.13-1.15.
Kubernetes v1.13-1.15 ships with v1beta of the admissionregistration.k8s.io API.

For Kubernetes 1.16 and later, Kubernetes ships with v1 of the admissionregistration.k8s.io API.
The v1 and v1beta ValidatingWebhookConfiguration objects have some differences.
Specifically, the v1 object has two additional required fields:

* `webhooks[0].sideEffects`: Required value.
Must specify one of None, NoneOnDryRun
* `webhooks[0].admissionReviewVersions`: Required value.
Must specify one of v1, v1beta1 as an array

When creating your ValidatingWebhookConfiguration object, use the right template.

*Kubernetes v1.13 to v1.15:*

=== Validating your setup

Validate that your webhook has been properly set up with one of the predefined admission rules.

The order in which the rules appear is the order in which they are evaluated.
Higher rules take precedence over lower rules.
Rules can reordered.
Use the hamburger icon to drag and drop rules into the right place.

[.procedure]
. Navigate to *Defend > Access > Admission* and verify there exist default admission rules and they are all enabled by default.

. Create the following YAML file to test the *Twistlock Labs - CIS - Privileged pod created* rule.

.. Create the following YAML file: *priv-pod.yaml*
+

----

. Create the privileged pod.
      
  $ kubectl apply -f priv-pod.yaml

. Verify an audit is created under *Monitor > Events > Admission Audits*.

. Clean up.
Delete the pod.

  kubectl delete -f priv-pod.yaml


=== Creating custom admission rules

Use https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/[Rego syntax] to create custom rules.
To learn more about the syntax, review the predefined rules that ship with Prisma Cloud.
Rules scripts are based on the admission review input JSON structure.
For more information, see: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/master/admission/v1beta1/types.go.
