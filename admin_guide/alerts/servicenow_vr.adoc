== ServiceNow alerts

ServiceNow is a workflow management platform.
It offers a number of security operations applications.
You can configure Prisma Cloud to route alerts to ServiceNow's Vulnerability Response application.

To integrate Prisma Cloud with ServiceNow, you'll need to create a ServiceNow endpoint to consume findings from the Prisma Cloud scanner.
The endpoint is created using ServiceNow's Scripted REST API mechanism.

Each vulnerability found by the Prisma Cloud scanner is mapped to a ServiceNow https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-security-management/page/product/vulnerability-response/reference/vulnerable-item-fields.html[vulnerable item].
Scanner data is mapped to vulnerable items as follows:

NOTE: Vulnerable items contain all CVEs reported by the Prisma Cloud scanner only if the corresponding CVEs also exist in ServiceNow’s vuln DB.
If a CVE doesn't exist in ServiceNow, the *Vulnerability (Reference)* field won't list it.

[.task]
=== Configuring ServiceNow

Create a ServiceNow endpoint to collect findings from the Prisma Cloud scanner.

*Prerequisites:*
Prisma Cloud Console is running.

[.procedure]
. In ServiceNow, create a Scripted REST API.
Name it *Prisma Vulnerabilities Report*.
+
For more information, see the official documentation https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-application-development/page/integrate/custom-web-services/task/t_CreateAScriptedRESTService.html[here].

. Create a new resource in your scripted REST service.
+
image::alerts_servicenow_new_resource.png[width=700]

. In *Name*, enter *report_findings*.

. In *HTTP method*, select *POST*.

. Download the script that implements the endpoint from Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Go to *Manage > Alerts > Add Profile*.

.. Click *Add Profile*.

.. In *Provider*, select *ServiceNow*.

.. In *Application*, select *Vulnerability Response*.

.. In *Scripted REST API*, click *Copy*.

.. In ServiceNow, paste the script into *Script*.

. Click *Submit* to create the resource.

. Construct the URL for your resource (endpoint), then copy it, and set it aside.
You'll need when you configure Prisma Cloud to send findings to ServiceNow.
+
The format for the base URL is: `\https://<SERVICENOW>/<BASE_API_PATH>`
+
For example: `\https://ena03291.service-now.com/api/paan/prisma_vulnerabilities_report`
+
Where:
+
* SERVICENOW -- URL for your ServiceNow instance.
* BASE_API_PATH -- Path to the scripted API service you just created.
+

=== Sending findings to ServiceNow

Alert profiles specify which events trigger the alert machinery, and to which channel alerts are sent.
You can send alerts to any combination of channels by creating multiple alert profiles.

Alert profiles consist of two parts:

*(1) Alert settings -- Who should get the alerts, and on what channel?*
Configure Prisma Cloud to integrate with ServiceNow and specify the people or places where alerts should be sent.
You can specify assignees and assignment groups.

*(2) Alert triggers -- Which events should trigger an alert to be sent?*
Specify which of the rules that make up your overall policy should trigger alerts.
For the Vulnerability Response application, you can send vulnerability and compliance alerts only.

[.task]
=== Create new alert profile

Create a new alert profile.

[.procedure]
. In *Manage > Alerts*, click *Add profile*.

. Enter a name for your alert profile.

. In *Provider*, select *ServiceNow*.


[.task]
=== Configure the channel

Configure Prisma Cloud to send alerts to ServiceNow, then validate the setup by sending a test alert.

*Prerequisites:* You've created a service account in ServiceNow with a base role of web_service_admin.

[.procedure]
. In *Application*, select *Vulnerability Response*.

. In *Scripted API URL*, enter the url of the vulnerabilities reporting api defined in ServiceNow (see ServiceNow config above). e.g. https://ven03718.service-now.com/api/paan/prisma_vulnerabilities_report

. In *Credential*, click *Add New*.

.. In *Type*, select *Basic authentication*.
+
This is currently the only auth method supported.

.. Enter a username and password.

. (Optional) In *Assignee*, enter the name of a user in ServiceNow that will be assigned the Vulnerable Items.
+
The assignee name isn't case-sensitive.

. (Optional) In *Assignment Group*, enter the name of a group in ServiceNow that will be assigned the Vulnerable Items.

. (Optional) In *CA certificate*, enter a CA certificate in PEM format.
Relevant only for on-premises deployments of ServiceNow.

. Click *Send Test Alert*.
If everything looks good, and you get an alert in ServiceNow, save the profile.
